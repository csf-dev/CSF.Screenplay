# CSF.Screenplay

**CSF.Screenplay** is the core logic of the CSF.Screenplay framework.
It provides the *engine* for running Screenplay Performances but provides very little in the way of capabilities such as [Abilities] or [Performables].

To make Screenplay useful, you will likely need to make use of one or more [Screenplay Extensions], and a [Test Framework Integration] if you wish to use Screenplay as a testing tool.
