    /// Implementers should return a string which indicates that the named actor is performing (present tense)

    /// For performables which return a value (Questions, or Tasks which behave like Questions), there is no

    /// Good report fragments are concise. Be aware that report fragments for Tasks (which are composed from other
    /// performables) do not need to go into detail about what they do. Users reading Screenplay reports are able
    /// to drill-down into Tasks to see what they are composed from, so if the user is curious as to what the
    /// task does, it is easy to discover.
    /// It is also strongly recommended to avoid periods (full stops) at the end of a report fragment.
    /// Whilst report fragments tend to be complete sentences, punctuation like this is distracting and reports
    /// are seldom presented as paragraphs of prose.

    /// <example>
    /// <para>
    /// For a performable which clicks a button (where the button itself has been constructor-injected into
    /// the performable instance), then a suitable return value might be a formatted string such as
    /// <c>{Actor name} clicks {Button}</c>, where the two placeholders indicated by braces: <c>{}</c> are
    /// substituted with the <paramref name="actor"/>'s <see cref="IHasName.Name"/> and a string representation of
    /// the button.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// For a performable which reads the temperature from a thermometer, a suitable return value might be a
    /// string in the format <c>{Actor name} reads the temperature</c>.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// For an ability which allows the actor to wash dishes then a suitable return value might be a string in the
