            <para>
                Developers are encouraged to store JavaScripts in their apps/tests as instances of this type and other
                related types (see the "See Also" section).
                This improves the reusability of the script, improves its presence in Screenplay reports and provides type safety.
                For more information, see <xref href="NamedScriptsArticle?text=the+named+scripts+article"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
                For scripts which are created in this manner, getting an <see cref="IPerformable"/> or <see cref="IPerformableWithResult{TResult}"/> for those
                scripts is very easy and type safe.  Use the <c>ExecuteAScript</c> method from the <see cref="PerformableBuilder"/> and
                the compiler will use generic type inference to select an appropriate overload.
                The parameters and return type will then be type-safe and of the appropriate number.
            </para>
            <para>
                Another benefit is that scripts defined and stored in instances of this type are reusable and easily catalogued.  See the <see cref="Scripts"/> helper
                class for an example of a catalogue of script objects which may be executed.  Once again, developers are encouraged to follow this pattern in their
                own applications/tests which use Screenplay &amp; Selenium.

            <para>
                Whilst the generic type parameters of this type have no direct bearing upon its members (such as properties), they are very useful when
                combined with the many overloads of the builder method <c>ExecuteAScript</c> in the <see cref="PerformableBuilder"/> class.
