            <para>
                This class is not a complete action, as it relies upon shared logic to retrieve the
                <see cref="SeleniumElement"/> upon which it shall act.  It has this in common with most of the Screenplay
                actions in the Selenium Plugin which operate upon a single element (those which derive from
                <see cref="ISingleElementPerformable"/>). In order for an instance of this class to be used as a full
                <xref href="PerformableGlossaryItem?text=performable"/>, the instance must be wrapped within an instance
                of <see cref="SingleElementPerformableAdapter"/>.
                Note that the builder method(s) mentioned above take care of this, so normal usage does not need to
                deal with this factor.
