                This class is not a complete <xref href="PerformableGlossaryItem?text=performable"/>, as it relies
                upon shared logic to retrieve the <see cref="SeleniumElement"/> which it queries.
                It has this in common with a number of Screenplay
                questions in the Selenium Plugin which observe a single element, those which derive from
                <see cref="ISingleElementPerformableWithResult{TResult}"/>. In order for this class to be used as a full-fledged
                <xref href="PerformableGlossaryItem?text=performable"/>, an instance of this type must be wrapped
                within an instance of <see cref="SingleElementPerformableWithResultAdapter{TResult}"/>.
                The adapter class provides the shared boilerplate logic which provides access to the Selenium Element.
                Note that the builder method(s) which create instances of this type include the 'wrap within an adapter'
                logic.  Normal usage of this performable, when creating it from a builder, does not need to be
                concerned with this factor.
