# Performables

Screenplay comes with a few pre-created [Performables] and [Builders], for common tasks.

## Supplementary builders

These are not complete performable builders; they are intended to supplement other builders such as those of your own design.
They handle commonly-used aspects of building performables in a reusable manner.
