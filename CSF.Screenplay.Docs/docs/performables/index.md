# Performables

Screenplay comes with a few pre-created [Abilities], [Performables] and [Builders], for common tasks.

[Abilities]: ../../glossary/Ability.md
[Performables]: ../../glossary/Performable.md
[Builders]: ../builderPattern/index.md

## Supplementary builders

These are not complete performable builders; they are intended to supplement other builders such as those of your own design.
They handle commonly-used aspects of building performables in a reusable manner.
