# Performance

A Performance is a start-to-finish script of **[Performables]** which describe a journey to an intended outcome.
A **[Screenplay]** typically contains many performances.

In a testing framework a Performance corresponds to a single test.
This might alternatively be called a "scenario", "test case" or "theory".

Performances have a direct representation in the Screenplay library: the [`Performance`] class.
