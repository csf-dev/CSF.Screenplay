# Scenario

A **Scenario** is a concept which is relevant when the Screenplay library is being used to perform automated tests. 
A scenario refers to a lifetime within such a testing framework or **[Integration]**.
That lifetime is that of a single test, which might be called a "test case" or "theory" or perhaps "example" in your chosen testing framework. 

The lifetime of a scenario very closely corresponds to that of a **[Performance]**.

Every scenario is contained within a **[Feature]**.
