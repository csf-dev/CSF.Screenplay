# Get started with Screenplay

## 1. Install Screenplay

The first step is to decide how you'd like to use it:

* [As a testing tool, with NUnit 3]
* [As a testing tool, with Reqnroll]
  * _Users of [the retired SpecFlow] should follow the Reqnroll guide_
* [As a process automation library], not as a testing tool
