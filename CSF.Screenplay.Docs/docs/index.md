# Get started with Screenplay

To get started with Screenplay, the first step is to decide how you'd like to use it:

* [As a testing tool, with NUnit 3]
* [As a testing tool, with Reqnroll]
  * _Users of [the retired SpecFlow] should follow the Reqnroll guide_
* [As a process automation library], not as a testing tool

[As a testing tool, with NUnit 3]: gettingStarted/nunit3/index.md
[As a testing tool, with Reqnroll]: gettingStarted/reqnroll/index.md

[As a process automation library]: gettingStarted/nonTesting/index.md
