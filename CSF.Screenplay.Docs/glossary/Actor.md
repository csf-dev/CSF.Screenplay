# Actor

An Actor is a representation of an autonomous, or at least seemingly-autonomous, person or system which controls the performance.
Each **[Performable]** in the **[Performance]** is performed/executed within the context of a single actor.

The most common example of an actor is a human being using the application.

Actors are directly represented in Screenplay by the [`Actor`] class.
Actors have **[Abilities]** which provide the requirements to interact with the application.
