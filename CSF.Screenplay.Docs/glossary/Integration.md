# Integration

An **Integration** refers to an integration library between the Screenplay library and a framework for performing automated tests.

The integration library performs the necessary scaffolding to make the Screenplay types available for dependency injection.
It also deals with the association of **[Scenarios]** with **[Performances]** and the lifetime of the whole **[Screenplay]**, culminating with the production of the **[Report]**.

[Scenarios]: Scenario.md
[Performances]: Performance.md
