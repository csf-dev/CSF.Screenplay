# Asset

An Asset forms part of a Screenplay **[Report]**.
Assets are **files** which are generated during the course of [Performances], which are saved to the filesystem.
These assets are saved alongside the report, and should be kept with it.

Assets may be any type of file system file, in any format conceivable.
Their usage/content is somewhat open-ended but they are best-used for files which help a reader understand the report of the [Screenplay's] performances.

Assets _are not intended_ for cases when Screenplay is used to actually generate output which will be used outside of reading the report.
Indeed, _asset files must not be created or saved_ if [reporting is disabled].
