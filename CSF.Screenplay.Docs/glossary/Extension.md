# Extension

The Screenplay library doesn't do much on its own.
The packages CSF.Screenplay.Abstractions and CSF.Screenplay offer very little in the way of [Abilities], [Actions] or [Questions].
Since these are the building blocks for writing [Tasks] and [Performances], developers won't get very far without installing one or more extensions.

There are [a few extensions available] which are maintained by the authors of CSF.Screenplay.

[Abilities]: Ability.md
[Actions]: Action.md
[Questions]: Question.md
[Tasks]: Task.md
[Performances]: xref:CSF.Screenplay.IPerformance
[a few extensions available]: ../docs/extensions/index.md

## Can't see what you need?

Developers are encouraged to write new extensions if they would like; it's not difficult.
See the [extending Screenplay documentation] for more information.
