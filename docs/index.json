This ability wraps a Stopwatch instance, allowing the actor to control & read it from the related actions. Properties Stopwatch Gets the stopwatch granted to the actor by this ability. public Stopwatch Stopwatch { get; } Property Value Stopwatch Methods GetReportFragment(Actor, IFormatsReportFragment) Gets a fragment of a Screenplay report, specific to the execution (performables) or gaining (abilities) of the current instance, for the specified actor. public ReportFragment GetReportFragment(Actor actor, IFormatsReportFragment formatter) Parameters actor Actor An actor for whom to write the report fragment formatter IFormatsReportFragment A report-formatting service Returns ReportFragment A human-readable report fragment. Examples For a performable which clicks a button (where the button itself has been constructor-injected into the performable instance), then a suitable return value might be a formatted string such as {Actor name} clicks {Button}, where the two placeholders indicated by braces: {} are substituted with the actor's Name and a string representation of the button. For a performable which reads the temperature from a thermometer, a suitable return value might be a string in the format {Actor name} reads the temperature. For an ability which allows the actor to wash dishes then a suitable return value might be a string in the format {Actor name} is able to wash the dishes. Remarks Implementers should return a string which indicates that the named actor is performing (present tense) the performable, for types which also implement a performable interface. For types which represent abilities, the implementer should return a string which indicates that the named actor is able to do something. In particular for abilities, to make them easily recognisable in reports, it helps to stick to the convention {Actor name} is able to {Ability summary}. For performables which return a value (Questions, or Tasks which behave like Questions), there is no need to include the returned value within the report fragment. The framework will include the return value in the report and will format it via a different mechanism. Good report fragments are concise. Be aware that report fragments for Tasks (which are composed from other performables) do not need to go into detail about what they do. Users reading Screenplay reports are able to drill-down into Tasks to see what they are composed from, so if the user is curious as to what the task does, it is easy to discover. It is also strongly recommended to avoid periods (full stops) at the end of a report fragment. Whilst report fragments tend to be complete sentences, punctuation like this is distracting and reports are seldom presented as paragraphs of prose."

That is - provided that the task scheduling software itself is not a part of the Screenplay Performance. Within the context of such a performance, the task scheduler executing its logic at the configured time would appear to be an autonomous action because nothing else within the scope of the performance prompted it. Conversely, a mouse trap would be a poor example of an actor; a mouse trap acts only reactively. The creature entering the trap would be the actor in such a performance. Remarks An actor should represent an autonomous or semi-autonomous system. Most commonly is a human being using a piece of software. An actor might also represent an automated system which acts according to policy, so long as configuring/initating that system is not a part of the IPerformance. Within a performance, each performable item is executed in the context of the actor which performed it. Actors have abilities which provide them the means by which to interact with the software. A single conceptual actor must be represented by a single instance of this type; two actors of the same name are not considered to be the same actor, nor will they behave as such. Instances of actor should have an object lifetime which lasts for the remainder of the performance in which they were created. Instances of actor must not be shared across performances. In other words, they should be scoped to only a single performance. A single performance might involve only one actor or it might involve many. If a performance makes use of multiple actors, the developer should consider making use of either or both of the ICast and/or IStage, which assist in the management of multiple actors.

Alternatively, file assets might constitute part of the output of a performance. Imagine an application of Screenplay which captures video from a security camera; that video file would be an asset. This method may be used from performables which generate and save asset files. They ensure that appropriate events are called and passed 'upward' through the Screenplay architecture, such that subscribers may be notified.

Implementing this interface permits the type to emit a human-readable value for when the type is used in a Performance. For Performables implementing this interface, the report fragment indicates that the performable has been executed in the Performance. For abilities which implement this interface, the report fragment is used when an Actor gains/is granted the ability. Methods GetReportFragment(Actor, IFormatsReportFragment) Gets a fragment of a Screenplay report, specific to the execution (performables) or gaining (abilities) of the current instance, for the specified actor. ReportFragment GetReportFragment(Actor actor, IFormatsReportFragment formatter) Parameters actor Actor An actor for whom to write the report fragment formatter IFormatsReportFragment A report-formatting service Returns ReportFragment A human-readable report fragment. Examples For a performable which clicks a button (where the button itself has been constructor-injected into the performable instance), then a suitable return value might be a formatted string such as {Actor name} clicks {Button}, where the two placeholders indicated by braces: {} are substituted with the actor's Name and a string representation of the button. For a performable which reads the temperature from a thermometer, a suitable return value might be a string in the format {Actor name} reads the temperature. For an ability which allows the actor to wash dishes then a suitable return value might be a string in the format {Actor name} is able to wash the dishes. Remarks Implementers should return a string which indicates that the named actor is performing (present tense) the performable, for types which also implement a performable interface. For types which represent abilities, the implementer should return a string which indicates that the named actor is able to do something. In particular for abilities, to make them easily recognisable in reports, it helps to stick to the convention {Actor name} is able to {Ability summary}. For performables which return a value (Questions, or Tasks which behave like Questions), there is no need to include the returned value within the report fragment. The framework will include the return value in the report and will format it via a different mechanism. Good report fragments are concise. Be aware that report fragments for Tasks (which are composed from other performables) do not need to go into detail about what they do. Users reading Screenplay reports are able to drill-down into Tasks to see what they are composed from, so if the user is curious as to what the task does, it is easy to discover. It is also strongly recommended to avoid periods (full stops) at the end of a report fragment. Whilst report fragments tend to be complete sentences, punctuation like this is distracting and reports are seldom presented as paragraphs of prose.

It is used to manage Actor objects for the duration of a IPerformance. Cast objects are always scoped to a IPerformance and have the same lifetime. Any actors created or tracked by a cast will also automatically share this lifetime. In terms of design patterns, the cast operates as both a registry: https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/registry.html and as a factory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern for actors. During the cast's lifetime, subsequent calls to an overload of GetActor using the same actor/persona name will return the instance of Actor as was created the first time the method was called with that name. A cast, and the actors managed by a cast, are independent per IPerformance, though. Developers are strongly advised to configure their actors via classes which derive from IPersona. This allows for sharing of common actor-setup logic such as abilities. In a Screenplay the cast is a dependency-injectable service which may be used within your performances.

    "summary": "Interface IPerformance Namespace CSF.Screenplay Assembly CSF.Screenplay.Abstractions.dll A Performance corresponds to a self-contained scope of Performables, performed by Actors, which results in success or failure. public interface IPerformance : IHasPerformanceIdentity, IHasServiceProvider, IDisposable, IBeginsAndEndsPerformance Inherited Members IHasPerformanceIdentity.PerformanceIdentity IHasServiceProvider.ServiceProvider IDisposable.Dispose() IBeginsAndEndsPerformance.BeginPerformance() IBeginsAndEndsPerformance.FinishPerformance(bool?) Remarks In Screenplay, a performance is .NET logic involving one or more Actor instances, executing one or more performable items. A Screenplay will be comprised of one or more performances. In practice a performance object, deriving from this interface, often corresponds to a .NET method in some manner. The method might be regular application logic or it might be a Test/Scenario, using the semantics of an applicable testing framework. The performance object (deriving from this interface) provides a name for the method (the performance name) as well as tracking its running-state. When using BDD-style testing frameworks, there might be a single .NET method to which the performance is linked. Nevertheless, a performance defines an execution scope (with a beginning and end). Even if that scope does not correspond neatly to a single method, it exists regardless. The body of a performance method typically creates one or more Actor via the IStage and then has the actor execute one or more performables. Particularly when using Screenplay for automated testing, these performables are organised into a beginning, middle and end, corresponding to the \"Given, When, Then\" design popular in testing. These three phases are included for use in Screenplay, declared in PerformancePhase. The use of performance phases is optional, although encouraged. Every performance method should return a result, indicating whether the performance was a success. A successful performance is one which progressed from beginning to end, and every step (performable) operated in the manner in which was expected. Additionally, when using Screenplay for software testing, a performance is a success if all its _assertions_ pass. A succesful performance should return true from its performance method. An unsuccessful one should return false. As noted above, when Screenplay is being used for automated testing, the performance method corresponds directly to a single test. In the testing framework that might be called a \"scenario\", a \"test\", a \"test case\", or a \"theory\". When using Screenplay within a testing integration, the performance corresponds very closely to the current Scenario. The object which implements this interface is the representation of the the method described above. One instance of this type - \"the performance object\" - corresponds to one execution of such a method. The performance object also corresponds to the lifetime of a dependency injection scope; a new scope is created for each performance. Within a DI scope, the performance object is an injectable service. You may wish to read a diagram showing how screenplays, performances, actors and performables relate to one another. Properties NamingHierarchy Gets an ordered list of identifiers which indicate the current performance's name within an organisational hierarchy. IReadOnlyList<IdentifierAndName> NamingHierarchy { get; } Property Value IReadOnlyList<IdentifierAndName> Examples If the current performance is to be named Joe can take out the Trash, and it is part of a parent name, named Joe can do his chores then the first identifier in the list will be named Joe can do his chores and the second will be named Joe can take out the Trash. Remarks A Screenplay typically contains more than one performance and may contain many. It is normal to organise performances into a hierarchical structure based upon their purpose, role or relationship. The position of the current performance in that naming structure is represented by the value of this property. The ordered list of IdentifierAndName instances indicate a path from the 'root' of the hierarchy (which has no inherent name) to the current performance. Identifier/name pairs which are earlier in the collection are considered to be closer to the root, whereas latter identifier/names are branch & leaf names. In this manner, they work very similarly to .NET namespaces. The earlier in the list that a name appears, the more general it should be, representing a wider category. When using Screenplay with Integration, this hierarchy of names would typically correspond to the naming convention used by the testing framework. That might be based upon .NET namespaces, classes and test methods for a more traditional unit testing framework. Alternatively, for a BDD-style testing framework, it could be named based upon human-readable feature & scenario names.

Given Jack can wash dishes And Jack has filled a basin with hot water When Jack washes a dinner plate Then Jack should have one clean dinner plate This format of test is perfectly functional, but each performable item needed to be qualified with the actor's name: \"Jack\". This could be more human-readable but also more reusable from a code perspective if we had a context of a 'current' actor, who we could refer to with a pronoun. With such a concept, our gherkin could read \"he has\" or \"he washes\" and could accept any one of a variety of pronouns. Remarks The Stage is an optional but recommended component of Screenplay, useful when a IPerformance involves repeated use of an Actor. It facilitates the use of passive voice and the use of pronouns within the logic of performances without needing to frequently repeat the Name of the actor. It is often more consise and easier to understand performances when some of the steps use the passive voice. In order to do this, there must be a concept which allows us to discern \"which actor is acting at the moment\". The stage provides this via the concept of a Spotlight. Either zero or one actor may be in the spotlight at any given time. If a new actor is placed in the spotlight then the previous actor is removed from it. Spotlighting an actor facilitates performance steps which use 'the current actor' instead of a specific named actor. The lifetime of a stage instance is equal to the lifetime of the current IPerformance. An actor in the spotlight will be consistent across the lifetime of the performance but will be independent of other performances. In a Screenplay the stage is a dependency-injectable service which may be used within your performances. The stage implicitly consumes some functionality from the ICast. If Spotlight(IPersona) is used, then the Actor to put in the spotlight will implicitly be retrieved using the cast, via GetActor(IPersona).

Spotlight(IPersona) Places an actor matching the specified persona into the spotlight, making them 'the current actor' on this stage.

Remarks A maximum of one actor may be in the spotlight at any time, so if a different actor is already in the spotlight as this method is used, then they will be implicitly removed and replaced by the actor derived from the persona. The actor who is in the spotlight may be retrieved by calling GetSpotlitActor().

The fictitious performable requires two parameters; the name of the food being eaten for lunch and how long the lunch break lasts. The time span builder is used for that second parameter. A consumer which uses this builder in an IPerformance, or another performable, might consume it as follows. using static EatLunchPerformableBuilder; // ... actor.PerformAsync(Eat(\"Sandwiches\").For(30).Minutes(), cancellationToken); A note for developers with access to the source code for this library. There is a small integration test which sets up and exercises the example above; it is named TimeSpanBuilderTests. Remarks When consuming Performable objects it is recommended to use the builder pattern to create them. A commonly-used 'parameter' which may be specified in builders is 'an amount of time', IE a TimeSpan. This builder is intended to supplement another builder, for the purpose of specifying an amount of time. The 'other' builder is passed as a constructor parameter to this builder, along with an absolute amount. The consumer should then execute one of the methods of this type, which selects the unit of time and thus determines the TimeSpan value. The method which determines the units then returns that other builder instance, allowing the building process to continue with that other builder. Whilst it is possible to create instances of this type via its public constructor, it is often easier to create instances using the static TimeSpanBuilder class. Constructors TimeSpanBuilder(TOtherBuilder, int) Initializes a new instance of TimeSpanBuilder<TOtherBuilder>. public TimeSpanBuilder(TOtherBuilder otherBuilder, int value) Parameters otherBuilder TOtherBuilder The other builder which shall be supplemented by this value int The absolute value of time, but without units Exceptions ArgumentNullException If otherBuilder is null.

In this manner, they work very similarly to .NET namespaces. The earlier in the list that a name appears, the more general it should be, representing a wider category. When using Screenplay with Integration, this hierarchy of names would typically correspond to the naming convention used by the testing framework. That might be based upon .NET namespaces, classes and test methods for a more traditional unit testing framework. Alternatively, for a BDD-style testing framework, it could be named based upon human-readable feature & scenario names.

Each of the methods upon this class corresponds to a PerformancePhase within the overall performance. By using these methods, the actor is down-cast to the appropriate interface that is specific to that phase, which activates appropriate functionality of the fluent interface. It is recommended to consume this functionality in your own logic via the using static directive, so that you may use the Given(Actor), When(Actor) & Then(Actor) methods stand-alone. Do not use these methods in your own Performable implementations. Doing so would reduce their reusability; use these methods only in your top-level performance logic.

Placeholders do not support any kind of format or alignment syntax. Developers are encouraged to choose meaningful names for their placeholders. The ReportFragment which is produced by this method will include the values associated with those placeholder names. This allows reporting infrastructure to work in a similar manner to the way in which structured logging is described in the article linked above. This provides a richer data model than simply a plain string. See Also ReportFragment"

A typical Screenplay solution will include many implementations of this interface, each of which is responsible for formatting a specific subset of values. Before an implementation of this type is used to format a value, the CanFormat(object) method should be called in order to determine whether the formatter is suitable for the value in question. This is an application of the strategy pattern: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern. For any concrete implementation of this interface to be considered in formatting a value with a report, its type must first be registered with the IFormatterRegistry. The FormatForReport(object) method should be used to create a human-readable string which represents the object in the report text.

Each instance builds and writes a single report file which corresponds to the execution of a single instance of Screenplay. To write a second report, or to write a report about a different Screenplay, please create a new instance of this type. This type works by accumulating reporting information about IPerformance instances using ScreenplayReportBuilder. Each of these performances may themselves accumulate information from the various events which occur during the performance lifetime. Once a performance is ended (success or otherwise), the completed PerformanceReport may be retrieved from the screenplay report builder. This is then written & flushed to the JSON file. The writing of JSON must be performed in a thread-safe manner, recall that multiple performances could be ongoing at the same time, in parallel. Additionally, it is important to write the JSON as-we-progress, rather than waiting until the end of the Screenplay, or the ScreenplayEnded event. That's because in many scenarios, the end of the Screenplay is triggered by the assembly-unload events for the whole process. This is particularly true for software testing frameworks. If we waited to write all of the JSON at the very end of the process then it is very likely that the write will be interrupted. Logic triggered from unload event handlers is permitted only a tiny amount of system compute resource and is inappropriate for performing anything substantial. This is why this type writes each performance to JSON as it completes, essentially streaming the information to the JSON file. This means that all that is left to be done when the Screenplay completes is to write a few closing symbols and then close the file.

A Screenplay is composed of at least one Performance and typically contains many performances. When the Screenplay architecture is applied to automated testing, an instance of this class corresponds to a complete test run, where each test corresponds to a performance. End-user logic, such as test logic, rarely interacts directly with this class. That is because the Screenplay object is generally consumed only by integration logic. It is recommended to create instances of this type by adding Screenplay to a dependency injection IServiceCollection via the extension method AddScreenplay(IServiceCollection, Action<ScreenplayOptions>) and then resolving an instance of this class from the service provider. Alternatively, if you do not wish to configure a service collection manually and just want an instance of this type then use the static Create(Action<IServiceCollection>, Action<ScreenplayOptions>) method. The Screenplay object is used to create instances of Performance via its ServiceProvider. You may wish to read a diagram showing how screenplays, performances, actors and performables relate to one another. Constructors Screenplay(IServiceProvider) Initialises a new instance of Screenplay. public Screenplay(IServiceProvider serviceProvider) Parameters serviceProvider IServiceProvider A service provider Remarks It is unlikely that developers should be executing this constructor directly. Consider using the static factory method Create(Action<IServiceCollection>, Action<ScreenplayOptions>). Alternatively, add Screenplay to an IServiceCollection using AddScreenplay(IServiceCollection, Action<ScreenplayOptions>) and then resolve an instance of this class from the service provider built from that service collection.

Returns Screenplay A Screenplay instance created from a new service collection. Remarks Use this method to create an instance of Screenplay when you are not already using an IServiceCollection. This method creates a new service collection instance, adds Screenplay to it and then creates & returns the Screenplay object instance. If you already have an IServiceCollection and you wish to integrate Screenplay into it, then use the extension method AddScreenplay(IServiceCollection, Action<ScreenplayOptions>) instead.

Returns Task<bool?> A task which completes when the performance's logic has completed, returning the result of the performance. Remarks This method is the primary entry point for beginning a Screenplay Performance. This method begins a new Dependency Injection Scope, and within that scope starts the performance, which executes the specified performance logic: performanceLogic. The return value from the performance logic should conform to the semantics of the parameter value passed to FinishPerformance(bool?). The namingHierarchy may be used to give the performance a name, so that its results (and subsequent report) may be identified. This parameter has the same semantics as NamingHierarchy. Note that if the performanceLogic raises a PerformableException then this method will catch that exception and not rethrow. In that case: An event will be raised with the event bus: IHasPerformanceEvents, specifically PerformableFailed. This will contain details of the exception which occurred; subscribers to be informed that the performance has failed. The performance will be immediately terminated and placed into the Failed state. Any other exception, which does not derive from PerformableException, will not be caught by this method and will propagate outward. These exceptions will be interpreted as an error within the Screenplay architecture, since the Actor class will always catch and rethrow any exception encountered from any overload of PerformAsync, wrapped as the inner exception of a PerformableException.

By default this collection contains one item. This will initialise an instance of IReporter and subscribe it to the event bus: IHasPerformanceEvents, which will activate Screenplay reporting. You may add further callbacks if you wish, to extend Screenplay; they are executed in the order in which they appear in this collection.

By default this collection contains one item, which disposes of the reporting infrastructure. You may add further callbacks if you wish, to extend Screenplay; they are executed in the order in which they appear in this collection. Be very wary of the use of this property. This is because it is usual for the end of a Screenplay to be triggered by the unloading of the the assemblies in the current process.

PerformanceEventsConfig An optional callback/action which exposes the various IHasPerformanceEvents which may be subscribed-to in order to be notified of the progress of a screenplay. public Action<IHasPerformanceEvents> PerformanceEventsConfig { get; set; } Property Value Action<IHasPerformanceEvents> Remarks The implementation of IHasPerformanceEvents is an event publisher which emits notifications when key evens occur during the lifetime of a Screenplay and its performances: IPerformance. If you wish, you may subscribe to these events from your own logic in order to develop new functionality or extend Screenplay. There is no need to add an explicit subscription to any events for the reporting infrastructure. Screenplay will automatically subscribe to this object from the reporting mechanism, unless the value of ReportPath means that reporting is disabled. ReportPath Gets a file system path at which a Screenplay report file will be written. public string ReportPath { get; set; } Property Value string Remarks As a Screenplay executes each IPerformance, it accumulates data relating to those performances, via its reporting mechanism. This information is then written to a JSON-formatted report file, which is saved at the path specified by this property. Once the Screenplay has completed this file may be inspected, converted into a different format and otherwise used to learn-about and diagnose the Screenplay. If this value is set to a relative file path, then it will be relative to the current working directory. If using Screenplay with a software testing integration, then this directory might not be easily determined. The default value for this property is a relative file path in the current working directory, using the filename ScreenplayReport_[timestamp].json where [timestamp] is replaced by the current UTC date & time in a format which is similar to ISO 8601, except that the : characters separating the hours, minutes and second are omitted. This is because they are typically not legal filename characters. A sample of a Screenplay Report filename using this default path is ScreenplayReport_2024-10-04T192345Z.json. If this property is set to null, or an empty/whitespace-only string, or if the path is not writable, then the reporting functionality will be disabled and no report will be written. At runtime, do not read this value directly; instead use an implementation of IGetsReportPath service to get the report path. ValueFormatters Gets a collection of concrete Type which implement IValueFormatter, which will be used to format values which are to appear in Screenplay reports. public IFormatterRegistry ValueFormatters { get; } Property Value IFormatterRegistry Remarks As noted in the documentation for IFormatterRegistry, the types in this collection are considered for use in reverse-collection-order. In other words, they will be tested using CanFormat(object) from last-to-first in this collection. Thus, generalized formatters should be placed at the beginning of this collection, where more specialized formatters should be placed toward the end. Make use of Add(T) to add new formatters to the end of this collection. It comes pre-loaded with three generalised formatters by default, in the following order. ToStringFormatter - a default/fallback implementation which may format any value at all HumanizerFormatter - a formatter for dates, times & time spans which uses the Humanizer library NameFormatter - which formats values that implement IHasName by emitting their name FormattableFormatter - which formats values that implement IFormattableValue There is no need to register/add any types listed in this registry into dependency injection. The methods which accept a configuration action of ScreenplayOptions will iterate through this collection and add every one of the implementation types found as transient-lifetime services in dependency injection."

Crucially it adds the Screenplay architecture to the Reqnroll architecture. Becuase this plugin leverages the Reqnroll/BoDi IObjectContainer, it is likely incompatible with other plugins which integrate with third party Dependency Injection libraries. This may be easily worked-around, though. If you are using a third-party DI plugin then do not use this plugin. Instead use the AddScreenplay(IServiceCollection, Action<ScreenplayOptions>) method to add Screenplay to that third-party DI system, when customising the dependency registrations. Adding Screenplay in that way is equivalent to the work done by this plugin. If you wish to further customise the dependency injection, such as adding injectable services for abilities or implementations of IPersona, add them to the relevant DI container. When using Reqnroll's default BoDi container this is described in the following article https://docs.reqnroll.net/latest/automation/context-injection.html#advanced-options. If using a third-party DI container then you should use that container's appropriate mechanism of adding services. Properties Screenplay Provides static access to the Screenplay instance. public static Screenplay Screenplay { get; } Property Value Screenplay Remarks This is required because the bindings for beginning/ending the Screenplay in ScreenplayBinding must be static. Those bindings use the [BeforeTestRun] and [AfterTestRun] hooks, which must be static, as documented here: https://docs.reqnroll.net/latest/automation/hooks.html#supported-hook-attributes Methods Initialize(RuntimePluginEvents, RuntimePluginParameters, UnitTestProviderConfiguration) public void Initialize(RuntimePluginEvents runtimePluginEvents, RuntimePluginParameters runtimePluginParameters, UnitTestProviderConfiguration unitTestProviderConfiguration) Parameters runtimePluginEvents RuntimePluginEvents runtimePluginParameters RuntimePluginParameters unitTestProviderConfiguration UnitTestProviderConfiguration Initialize(RuntimePluginEvents, RuntimePluginParameters, UnitTestProviderConfiguration) public void Initialize(RuntimePluginEvents runtimePluginEvents, RuntimePluginParameters runtimePluginParameters, UnitTestProviderConfiguration unitTestProviderConfiguration) Parameters runtimePluginEvents RuntimePluginEvents runtimePluginParameters RuntimePluginParameters unitTestProviderConfiguration UnitTestProviderConfiguration"

It is irrelevant there. In SpecFlow 3.x, the Steps class has three methods named Given, When & Then which can cause a naming conflict with the same-named methods of PerformanceStarter. If you using the performance starter in the recommended way, then the methods of these two types can become ambiguous and force the developer to write additional boilerplate which spoils the ease-of-comprehension for Screenplay-based test logic. This subclass of Steps provides a workaround to that situation. Instead of deriving from the SpecFlow Steps class and including using static CSF.Screenplay.PerformanceStarter; at the top of your source file, have your bindings derive from this class instead. This provides Given, When, Then methods which have the same functionality as those in PerformanceStarter but in a manner which will not cause a name-resolution conflict. Note that in SpecFlow 4.x and up, and Reqnroll, this problem is irrelevant; there is no gain in using this subclass over the using static technique. The Given, When & Then methods upon the SpecFlow Steps class were removed in v4.x, and never existed in any version of Reqnroll. This means that the naming conflict won't be present and that there is no need for your bindings to derive from this class instead of the official Steps class.

For an ability which allows the actor to wash dishes then a suitable return value might be a string in the format {Actor name} is able to wash the dishes. Remarks Implementers should return a string which indicates that the named actor is performing (present tense) the performable, for types which also implement a performable interface. For types which represent abilities, the implementer should return a string which indicates that the named actor is able to do something. In particular for abilities, to make them easily recognisable in reports, it helps to stick to the convention {Actor name} is able to {Ability summary}. For performables which return a value (Questions, or Tasks which behave like Questions), there is no need to include the returned value within the report fragment. The framework will include the return value in the report and will format it via a different mechanism. Good report fragments are concise. Be aware that report fragments for Tasks (which are composed from other performables) do not need to go into detail about what they do. Users reading Screenplay reports are able to drill-down into Tasks to see what they are composed from, so if the user is curious as to what the task does, it is easy to discover. It is also strongly recommended to avoid periods (full stops) at the end of a report fragment.

Using this class directly requires that a WaitUntilPredicate instance is provided to the constructor. The specified predicate provides both the logic to evaluate and a human-readable name for the wait condition. Constructors NamedWaitBuilder() Initializes a new instance of the NamedWaitBuilder class. protected NamedWaitBuilder() Remarks This constructor is protected, as it is only to be used by derived classes which provide an alternative implementation of GetWaitUntilPredicate().

Methods ForAtMost(TimeSpan) Configures the wait action to use a specified maximum timeout. public NamedWaitBuilder ForAtMost(TimeSpan timeout) Parameters timeout TimeSpan The maximum amount of time to wait. Returns NamedWaitBuilder The same wait builder, so that calls may be chained. Remarks If the timeout is reached before the predicate function returns a true result then the wait will end, and an exception will be raised. This method is optional. If it is not called then the default behaviour of the Wait question will be used. See the documentation for that class for more details. GetWaitUntilPredicate() Gets the wait-until predicate, which wraps both the predicate logic and a human-readable name. protected virtual WaitUntilPredicate<bool> GetWaitUntilPredicate() Returns WaitUntilPredicate<bool> The wait-until predicate instance. IgnoringTheseExceptionTypes(params Type[]) Configures the wait action which will be created to ignore exceptions of the specified types. public NamedWaitBuilder IgnoringTheseExceptionTypes(params Type[] ignoredExceptionTypes) Parameters ignoredExceptionTypes Type[] A collection of exception types to be ignored when polling the predicate function. Returns NamedWaitBuilder Remarks When evaluating the predicate/condition function, the WebDriver may throw exceptions, such as if an element doesn't exist. Use this method to specify a collection of exception types which should be ignored. If an exception thrown of one of these types then the WebDriver wait will treat it the same as a false outcome and continue to poll the predicate. This method is optional. If it is not called then by default, only exceptions of type TargetNotFoundException will be ignored. That is - waiting will continue if the target element does not yet exist. If you choose to replace this collection with your own, be sure to include the type TargetNotFoundException if you wish to retain that behaviour. Exceptions InvalidOperationException Thrown if the ignored exception types have already been set. WithPollingInterval(TimeSpan) Configures the wait action which will be created to use a specified polling interval. public NamedWaitBuilder WithPollingInterval(TimeSpan pollingInterval) Parameters pollingInterval TimeSpan The polling interval to use. Returns NamedWaitBuilder The same wait builder, so that calls may be chained. Remarks The polling interval is the amount of time that the WebDriver will wait between each evaluation of the predicate function. This method is optional. If it is not called then Screenplay will not specify a polling interval. Selenium will then use its own default interval, which is 500ms. Choosing a polling interval is a balance between responsiveness and resource usage. A shorter polling interval may lead to quicker detection of the condition being met (a more responsive predicate), but at the cost of increased network usage as more round-trips are made to the WebDriver. Conversely, a longer polling interval reduces network traffic but may result in a less responsive predicate. If you are not sure what to choose, it's recommended not to use this method; use the default provided by Selenium. Exceptions InvalidOperationException Thrown if the polling interval has already been set."

    "summary": "Class UnnamedWaitBuilder Namespace CSF.Screenplay.Selenium.Builders Assembly CSF.Screenplay.Selenium.dll Provides a builder for configuring wait actions in Selenium. public class UnnamedWaitBuilder : NamedWaitBuilder, IGetsPerformable Inheritance object NamedWaitBuilder UnnamedWaitBuilder Implements IGetsPerformable Inherited Members NamedWaitBuilder.Timeout NamedWaitBuilder.PollingInterval NamedWaitBuilder.IgnoredExceptionTypes object.Equals(object) object.Equals(object, object) object.GetHashCode() object.GetType() object.MemberwiseClone() object.ReferenceEquals(object, object) object.ToString() Remarks This class provides methods for configuring various aspects of a wait action, such as timeout, polling interval, and ignored exception types. It also provides a way to set a human-readable name for the wait condition. Constructors UnnamedWaitBuilder(Func<IWebDriver, bool>) Initializes a new instance of the UnnamedWaitBuilder class with a specified timeout. public UnnamedWaitBuilder(Func<IWebDriver, bool> predicate) Parameters predicate Func<IWebDriver, bool> The predicate which ends the wait when it returns a successful result. Methods ForAtMost(TimeSpan) Configures the wait action to use a specified maximum timeout. public UnnamedWaitBuilder ForAtMost(TimeSpan timeout) Parameters timeout TimeSpan The maximum amount of time to wait. Returns UnnamedWaitBuilder The same wait builder, so that calls may be chained. Remarks If the timeout is reached before the predicate function returns a true result then the wait will end, and an exception will be raised. This method is optional. If it is not called then the default behaviour of the Wait question will be used. See the documentation for that class for more details. GetWaitUntilPredicate() Gets the wait-until predicate, which wraps both the predicate logic and a human-readable name. protected override WaitUntilPredicate<bool> GetWaitUntilPredicate() Returns WaitUntilPredicate<bool> The wait-until predicate instance. IgnoringTheseExceptionTypes(params Type[]) Configures the wait action which will be created to ignore exceptions of the specified types. public UnnamedWaitBuilder IgnoringTheseExceptionTypes(params Type[] ignoredExceptionTypes) Parameters ignoredExceptionTypes Type[] A collection of exception types to be ignored when polling the predicate function. Returns UnnamedWaitBuilder Remarks When evaluating the predicate/condition function, the WebDriver may throw exceptions, such as if an element doesn't exist. Use this method to specify a collection of exception types which should be ignored. If an exception thrown of one of these types then the WebDriver wait will treat it the same as a false outcome and continue to poll the predicate. This method is optional. If it is not called then no exception types will be ignored. Exceptions InvalidOperationException Thrown if the ignored exception types have already been set. Named(string) Configures the wait action to use a short, descriptive, human-readable name summarising what the performable is waiting for. public UnnamedWaitBuilder Named(string name) Parameters name string The name to use. Returns UnnamedWaitBuilder The same wait builder, so that calls may be chained. Remarks Use of this method is optional but strongly recommended. Giving the wait performable a name will make it easier to understand. Exceptions ArgumentNullException Thrown if the name is null. InvalidOperationException Thrown if the name has already been set. WithPollingInterval(TimeSpan) Configures the wait action which will be created to use a specified polling interval. public UnnamedWaitBuilder WithPollingInterval(TimeSpan pollingInterval) Parameters pollingInterval TimeSpan The polling interval to use. Returns UnnamedWaitBuilder The same wait builder, so that calls may be chained. Remarks The polling interval is the amount of time that the WebDriver will wait between each evaluation of the predicate function. This method is optional. If it is not called then Screenplay will not specify a polling interval. Selenium will then use its own default interval, which is 500ms. Choosing a polling interval is a balance between responsiveness and resource usage. A shorter polling interval may lead to quicker detection of the condition being met (a more responsive predicate), but at the cost of increased network usage as more round-trips are made to the WebDriver. Conversely, a longer polling interval reduces network traffic but may result in a less responsive predicate. If you are not sure what to choose, it's recommended not to use this method; use the default provided by Selenium. Exceptions InvalidOperationException Thrown if the polling interval has already been set."

Filter(SeleniumElementCollection) Gets a builder which may be used to create a performable question which filters a collection of elements for those which match a specification. public static FilterElementsBuilder Filter(SeleniumElementCollection elements) Parameters elements SeleniumElementCollection The collection of elements to filter. Returns FilterElementsBuilder A builder with which consuming logic must provide a specification. Examples Here is a sample usage which combines both the QueryPredicatePrototypeBuilder and FilterElementsBuilder classes: using static CSF.Screenplay.Selenium.PerformableBuilder; var buyNowButtons = await actor.PerformAsync(Filter(someElements).ForThoseWhich(have => have.Clickability(true).And(have.Text(\"Buy now\")), cancellationToken); The code sample above assumes that actor is an instance of ICanPerform, that someElements is a collection of SeleniumElement instances, and that cancellationToken is a CancellationToken instance. It would filter the elements in someElements to only those which are clickable and have the text \"Buy now\". See Also FilterElementsBuilder QueryPredicatePrototypeBuilder FindAnElementOnThePage() Gets a builder which may be used to create a performable action which finds a single element within the body of the page. public static FindElementBuilder FindAnElementOnThePage() Returns FindElementBuilder A builder, which may be used to configure/get a question that finds an element Remarks If you want to find an element which is a descendent of a specified target, consider using FindAnElementWithin(ITarget) instead.

This allows it to be quickly identified in the report. If you only want to take a screenshot and save it as an asset file, please consider TakeAndSaveAScreenshot() instead of this method. SelectTheOption(int) Gets a builder which will create a performable which represents an actor selecting a specified option from a <select> element. public static FromTargetActionBuilder SelectTheOption(int optionIndex) Parameters optionIndex int The zero-based index of an option to select Returns FromTargetActionBuilder A builder by which a target element is chosen Remarks This overload selects the option by its zero-based index. As might be expected, the target which is specified in the builder must represent a <select> element or the resulting performable will raise an exception. SelectTheOption(string) Gets a builder which will create a performable which represents an actor selecting a specified option from a <select> element. public static FromTargetActionBuilder SelectTheOption(string optionText) Parameters optionText string The text of the option to select Returns FromTargetActionBuilder A builder by which a target element is chosen Remarks This overload selects the option by its displayed text. As might be expected, the target which is specified in the builder must represent a <select> element or the resulting performable will raise an exception. SelectTheOptionWithValue(string) Gets a builder which will create a performable which represents an actor selecting a specified option from a <select> element. public static FromTargetActionBuilder SelectTheOptionWithValue(string optionValue) Parameters optionValue string The underlying value of the option to select Returns FromTargetActionBuilder A builder by which a target element is chosen Remarks This overload selects the option by its underlying value attribute, instead of its displayed text. As might be expected, the target which is specified in the builder must represent a <select> element or the resulting performable will raise an exception. TakeAScreenshot() Gets a performable question which takes a screenshot of the current web page and returns it. public static IPerformableWithResult<Screenshot> TakeAScreenshot() Returns IPerformableWithResult<Screenshot> A performable Remarks If you only want to take a screenshot and save it as an asset file, please consider TakeAndSaveAScreenshot() instead of this method. This method will raise an exception if the WebDriver is not capable of taking screenshots. If you want to avoid this, consider using TakeAScreenshotIfSupported() instead. TakeAScreenshotIfSupported() Gets a performable question which takes a screenshot of the current web page and returns it, if the WebDriver is capable of doing so. public static IPerformableWithResult<Screenshot> TakeAScreenshotIfSupported() Returns IPerformableWithResult<Screenshot> A performable Remarks If you only want to take a screenshot and save it as an asset file, please consider TakeAndSaveAScreenshot() instead of this method. This method will not raise an exception if the WebDriver is not capable of taking screenshots. Instead, it will return a value task of null. If you wish to use a performable which will raise an exception if the WebDriver is not capable of taking screenshots, consider using TakeAScreenshot() instead. TakeAndSaveAScreenshot() Gets a performable taek which takes a screenshot and saves it to a file, using an optional short name. public static TakeAndSaveScreenshotBuilder TakeAndSaveAScreenshot() Returns TakeAndSaveScreenshotBuilder A performable Remarks This method may be used to specify a short name for the screenshot. This allows it to be quickly identified in the report. This method will raise an exception if the WebDriver is not capable of taking screenshots. If you want to avoid this, consider using TakeAndSaveAScreenshotIfSupported() instead. TakeAndSaveAScreenshotIfSupported() Gets a performable taek which takes a screenshot and saves it to a file, using an optional short name. public static TakeAndSaveScreenshotBuilder TakeAndSaveAScreenshotIfSupported() Returns TakeAndSaveScreenshotBuilder A performable Remarks This method may be used to specify a short name for the screenshot. This allows it to be quickly identified in the report. This method will not raise an exception if the WebDriver is not capable of taking screenshots. Instead, it will do nothing. If you wish to use a performable which will raise an exception if the WebDriver is not capable of taking screenshots, consider using TakeAndSaveAScreenshot() instead. WaitFor(TimeSpan) Gets a performable action that waits for a specified amount of time. public static WaitForSomeTime WaitFor(TimeSpan duration) Parameters duration TimeSpan The duration for which to wait. Returns WaitForSomeTime A performable action. Remarks This kind of wait waits for a specified time. If you want to wait until a condition is met, consider using either WaitUntil(Func<IWebDriver, bool>) or WaitUntil(IBuildsElementPredicates) instead. WaitUntil(IBuildsElementPredicates) Gets a builder which will create a performable question that waits until a predicate returns a successful result. public static NamedWaitBuilder WaitUntil(IBuildsElementPredicates predicate) Parameters predicate IBuildsElementPredicates A predicate which, when it returns a successful result, the wait is over. Returns NamedWaitBuilder A builder for creating a wait action. Remarks The prupose of waiting in this manner is to wait for something to happen on the web page, such as an element being present, or having content that matches a specification. The builder object returned by this method has a number of optional configuration methods. Create the predicate paramater value by using one of the following extension methods. These extension methods provide a fluent interface to create a predicate for one or more elements (described by a single ITarget), as well as providing a human-readable name for the predicate. Has(ITarget) AllHave(ITarget) Exceptions ArgumentNullException Thrown if the predicate is null. ArgumentException Thrown if the result type of the predicate is a value type other than boolean. WaitUntil(Func<IWebDriver, bool>) Gets a builder which will create a performable question that waits until a predicate returns a true result. public static UnnamedWaitBuilder WaitUntil(Func<IWebDriver, bool> predicate) Parameters predicate Func<IWebDriver, bool> A predicate which, when it returns a true result, the wait is over. Returns UnnamedWaitBuilder A builder for creating a wait action. Remarks The purpose of waiting in this manner is to wait for something to happen on the web page, such as an element being present, or having content that matches a specification. The builder object returned by this method has a number of optional configuration methods. Of these, consumers are strongly encouraged to use Named(string) to give the wait action a short, descriptive name which will appear in reports. Take note that it is very normal for the predicate to make use of closures to access elements from outside its own scope. For example, the predicate function may refer to an element which is referenced by a variable in the calling method. Where possible, consider using the other overload of this method: WaitUntil(IBuildsElementPredicates), as it provides a more fluent interface for describing the predicate. This overload is provided only for scenarios in which the predicate to end the wait is too complex to be easily expressed using the fluent interface. Exceptions ArgumentNullException Thrown if the predicate is null. ArgumentException Thrown if the result type of the predicate is a value type other than boolean."

Remarks When specifying a base URI via this ability, remember to include a trailing slash where applicable. The manner in which relative URIs will be resolved into absolute ones, when this ability is present, is via the two-parameter overload of the Uri constructor, taking a Uri and a string. As stated in the documentation for this constructor: If the baseUri has relative parts (like /api), then the relative part must be terminated with a slash, (like /api/), if the relative part of baseUri is to be preserved in the constructed Uri.

Instances of endpoints (types which derive from this base class) are typically stored as static readonly values in Screenplay-based logic. Here, they can be reused by tasks or other performables. Choose an appropriate implementation of this type based upon your intended use case.

Also, endpoints which expect a request body: \"parameterized endpoints\" include a generic type parameter for the type of that request payload. There are also specialisations of these parameterized endpoint classes for those which expect an object serialized to JSON as their request payload. When writing custom endpoints, do not derive directly from this type. Usually one of the following pre-written endpoint types will be suitable for your use case.

Where it comes to endpoints, it is normal that the human-readable name might be influenced by state which is held within the specific endpoint implementation.

Remarks If this set to a non-null value, then the HTTP client used to make the request will include cancellation after an amount of time (equal to this timespan) has passed. This logic is handled within the MakeWebApiRequests action. If this action is not used then this timeout might not be honoured. The logic for honouring this timeout is contained within the performables which are shipped with this library: SendTheHttpRequest SendTheHttpRequestAndGetTheResponse<TResponse> SendTheHttpRequestAndGetJsonResponse<TResponse> If different performables are used to interact with the current endpoint then they must implement any timeout-related logic themselves, or else this value will not be honoured. Methods GetBaseHttpRequestMessageBuilder() Gets a HttpRequestMessageBuilder from the state of the current instance. protected HttpRequestMessageBuilder GetBaseHttpRequestMessageBuilder() Returns HttpRequestMessageBuilder An HTTP request message builder Remarks Derived types should make use of this method to get the request message builder from the state of this base class.

    "summary": "Screenplay's capabilities Intuitive, human-readable design Promotes maximum code reuse Produces human-readable reports Integration with testing frameworks Extensibility via plug-in extensions Not just for automated testing Screenplay follows an intuitive design The logic of a Screenplay Performance or Task is obvious, to both programmers and non-programmers alike. Through use of static builders, Screenplay logic forms a fluent interface which is instantly readable. For example, this is a line of Screenplay-based code: await Given(webster).WasAbleTo(AddAProductToTheirCartNamed(\"Blue widget\")); Screenplay promotes code reuse Screenplay ruthlessly follows SOLID design principles, particularly SRP and OCP. The architecture of Performables permits unlimited levels of composition via Tasks. Developers are also encouraged to use Personas to configure and manage the Actors which participate in a Screenplay. Screenplay produces reports Whenever a Screenplay executes, a record of what happened is saved in JSON format. This JSON file is computer-readable, but it may be converted to a human-readable report using the included utility. Screenplay integrates with Testing frameworks If you would like to use Screenplay as a test-authoring framework then you are in luck. Screenplay has integrations with testing frameworks, out of the box: NUnit 3 Reqnroll and the now-retired SpecFlow The community is encouraged to create and contribute additional integrations if they wish. The source code of the existing integrations, and the documentation website for your chosen test framework, are good places to start for writing a new integration. Screenplay is extensible Screenplay has two primary extension points, test-framework integrations (above) and Extensions. Extensions provide Screenplay with the capabilities to interact-with and automate additional technologies. Some extensions are provided already: Selenium WebDriver Web APIs The community is encouraged to create and contribute additional extensions if they wish. Writing an extension is a matter of writing Ability, Action and Question classes, along with any appropriate Builders. The source code for the existing Extensions are a good place to start in learning how to create a new one. Screenplay isn't limited to software testing Whilst Screenplay is a popular pattern for automated testing, particularly web-browser-based testing, it doesn't have to be limited to that use-case. Screenplay may be invoked as a standalone process-automation tool. See the documentation of the ExecuteAsPerformanceAsync<T> method for information and examples for the recommended way to use Screenplay outside of a testing framework."

    "summary": "Screenplay reports As a Screenplay executes, the framework produces and saves a JSON-format report file, recording each Performance. This file is a machine-readable record of every Actor and every Performable which was included in the performances. It records the results from the performables (where applicable) as well as the details of errors, where they occur. Where the report JSON file is saved Over the course of a Screenplay, the JSON file will be written and saved at a path defined by the ScreenplayOptions.ReportPath option. As the documentation for that option notes, the default if it has not been set is to write the report to a file in the current working directory. The default filename includes a representation of the current timestamp, so each report is likely to have a unique filename. This path may be altered by specifying a different set of options to the AddScreenplay service collection extension method. Converting JSON to a human-readable report JSON is a very good machine-readable format for reports, but it's not a great choice for reading by humans. CSF.Screenplay offers a utility to convert a JSON-format report into a human-readable single-page HTML file, viewable in any modern web browser. This tool is the CSF.Screenplay.JsonToHtmlReport command-line utility. The command-line options to this utility are documented in the class ReportConverterOptions.

    "title": "Where Screenplay is suitable for testing | Screenplay",
    "summary": "Where Screenplay is suitable for testing The Screenplay pattern is a recommended tool for writing automated tests for application software. Unlike NUnit or Reqnroll (or many others) Screenplay is not a complete testing framework. Rather, Screenplay integrates with your chosen testing framework to assist in the writing of test logic. Screenplay is not a silver bullet; some kinds of tests could benefit from Screenplay and others will not. Some testing scenarios are listed below, along with a brief consideration as to whether Screenplay is likely to be relevant. Terminology can differ between developers, so each type of test begins with a short definition. Ideal: System tests Also known as \"end-to-end tests\"; this kind of test exercises and tests the full deployed application without the use of any test fakes. The application might be set up/configured in a controlled environment but it runs and is exercised in the same way it would in production. System tests are an ideal candidate for the use of Screenplay. System tests are often written from a user's perspective and test meaningful, observable behaviour of the application, such as a complete user story. Screenplay excels in this area of test design. Unsuitable: Unit tests Unit tests test the functionality of a small unit of code in isolation. Typically this is a single class or function. Anything external to the tested unit is replaced with a test fake or a mock. Screenplay is not recommended for use in unit testing. Unit tests are rarely written from an end-user's perspective and often do not test complete application behaviour, such as a user story. A unit test will only test only a small aspect of some functionality. When this aspect is considered in isolation it may be meaningless, or too abstract to comprehend for an end-user. Additionally: The steps involved in unit tests should be short & simple, with minimal need for code reuse or composition The steps are typically difficult to describe in the application's 'behaviour domain', only with language that a software developer would understand Perhaps useful: Integration tests Integration tests live at a point in the spectrum of testing between unit & system tests. Like unit tests, they execute logic via its programming API instead of testing the deployed application. Unlike unit tests, each integration test exercises logic across many units of code/classes. Thus, it is common for integration tests to test high-level APIs which represent complete user stories. Integration tests might include some test fakes. Usually these are limited to things which are difficult or expensive to control. Asynchronous web services & databases are typically replaced with test fakes in integration tests. For integration tests, we recommend that you evaluate for yourself whether Screenplay is useful. In some projects/applications, Screenplay will be excellent for integration tests. In others it might not. You will find Screenplay most useful if your integration tests test complete user stories. This is particularly true if the test/sample scenarios would be recognisable to end users, even if described in an abstract manner, for example without reference to a user interface. Recommended: Use BDD-style tests Screenplay is a great tool when used alongside Behaviour Driven Development (BDD). Whilst the use of a BDD framework such as Reqnroll is not at all mandatory, those familiar with BDD will quickly see the synergies with Screenplay."

    "title": "Advice for writing tests with Screenplay | Screenplay",
    "summary": "Advice for writing tests with Screenplay Whichever testing integration you choose to use, there are some general pieces of advice and best practice which apply. Use high-level tasks Avoid the use of too many tasks/performables in each test. Too many performables in a single test makes it hard to comprehend at-a-glance and forces the reader to commit too much detail to memory. Rather than using many performables at the top-level of your tests, create high-level tasks which compose and simplify some of that detail into a single logical step. When using a method-driven testing framework, such as NUnit, five performables in a single test method is a reasonable number. More than approximately ten performables is too many. When using a binding-driven testing framework like Reqnroll, each binding should ideally correspond to at-most one performable. Use the Performance Starter Your top-level test logic should consume its performables via the class PerformanceStarter. This provides for a clear given/when/then appearance to your top-level test logic. Consider a fluent-style assertions library Depending upon the testing framework you have chosen, you may or may not have access to fluent-style assertions functionality. NUnit, for example, provides assertions based upon the constraint model, which is an extensible fluent-style syntax. If your chosen testing framework does not provide easy-to-read assertions, consider an external assertion library. Assertion libraries to consider include Shouldly and Fluent Assertions. Do not include assertions in performables It might be tempting to include assertion syntax within performables such as tasks. This is not recommended. Where assertions appear within performables: They reduce the reusability of the performables They create a dependency between your performables and your testing framework/assertion library They can make test logic harder to read and understand It is recommended to keep your performables/tasks free from assertions. In your test code, use questions or question-like tasks to get values/data from the system under test. Write your assertions in your main test logic, asserting that the values retrieved are as-expected."

Because (as shown below) the methods tend to be very short - typically only one line - and because of the convenience, consider using one static class for all related builders/performables in a logical package. Performables with no parameters To build a performable which requires no parameters, only the static method is required. Good names for such a static method begin with a verb, which indicates that it does something. Here is an example for a fictitious MakeACupOfTea performable. public static IPerformble MakeTheTea() => new MakeACupOfTea(); Substitute the performable interface (the return type) as applicable. Performables with one parameter If a performable requires one constructor-injected parameter then it is often possible to work this into the method name of a simple static method, similar to above. Consider this fictitious example. public static IPerformble MakeACupOf(string hotDrink) => new MakeACupOfHotDrink(hotDrink); This might be consumed as MakeACupOf(\"Coffee\"), for example. This is still very readable. Performables with many parameters Where it comes to performables which have more than one parameter then it is often best for the static entry point method to instead return a specialised builder for that performable. That specialised builder type exposes further methods which may be used to provide the other parameters in a human-readable manner. Particularly if one or more of the parameters is optional, consider writing an implicit conversion operator overload for your specialised builder type. The return type of such an operator should be the appropriate concrete performable type. Such an operator would allow the use of the builder to get the performable without needing an explicit .Build() method. Tip Beware of writing performables with too many parameters; this can make them difficult to consume. Consider writing high-level performables with fewer parameters, representing actual use cases. Example Here is an example of a fictitious builder. public class MakeAHotDrinkBuilder { readonly string drinkType; string whitener; int sugars; public MakeAHotDrinkBuilder WithMilk() { whitener = \"Milk\"; return this; } public MakeAHotDrinkBuilder WithCream() { whitener = \"Cream\"; return this; } public MakeAHotDrinkBuilder WithSugars(int howMany) { sugars = howMany; return this; } public MakeAHotDrinkBuilder(string drinkType) { this.drinkType = drinkType; } public static implicit operator MakeACupOfHotDrink(MakeAHotDrinkBuilder builder) => new MakeACupOfHotDrink(builder.drinkType, builder.whitener, sugars); } // Separately, in a static entry-point class: public static MakeAHotDrinkBuilder MakeACupOf(string drinkType) => new MakeAHotDrinkBuilder(drinkType); The above example might be consumed from a Task in the following manner: await actor.PerformAsync(MakeACupOf(\"Tea\").WithMilk().WithSugars(2), cancellationToken);"

Integrating with an existing container When using an existing IServiceCollection for you application, either using Screenplay standalone or with a test framework that integrates with dependency injection, then adding services is simple. Just add your services to the container (the service collection) as normal; they will be available to resolve and inject over the course of the Screenplay. Using the static Create factory If you do not wish to integrate Screenplay into an existing dependency injection container then the simplest way to create an instance of Screenplay is to use the static Screenplay.Create factory method. This method offers an optional parameter to provide an Action<IServiceCollection>. If you do so, then you may provide a customization action which adds additional services to the container. These services will be integrated into the self-contained service collection which the Create method creates for Screenplay. var screenplay = Screenplay.Create(services => { services.AddTransient<MyCustomService>(); // ... and anything further you want here }); A reminder on lifetime scopes Remember that Screenplay imposes some requirements upon service lifetime: The Screenplay object is always a singleton Each Performance is always executed within its own lifetime scope Add your own services to dependency injection accordingly."

    "title": "Injecting services | Screenplay",
    "summary": "Injecting services There are a few techniques in which injecting dependencies is relevant. These are summarised below. All but one of these techniques provide access to the services which are added to the container. Into test logic When using automated test logic based upon Screenplay, the use of dependency injection typically takes one of two forms. Which of these depends upon the nature and paradigm of the test framework. For frameworks which are based on test methods such as NUnit, services are typically injected via method parameter injection into the test methods. If Screenplay were to be extended to work with frameworks such as xUnit or MSTest then this is likely to be the technique used. For frameworks which are based on binding classes such as Reqnroll, services are constructor-injected into binding classes. Use dependencies injected in this way to get access to commonly-used Screenplay services and anything else required at the root level of your test logic. Into standalone performance logic If you are using Screenplay standalone then the Screenplay.ExecuteAsPerformanceAsync permits resolution of dependencies via its parameter. That parameter is a Func<IServiceProvider,CancellationToken,Task<bool?>>. The service provider may be used to resolve dependency services for the performance's logic. Developers are urged to consider encapsulating their performance logic in implementations of IHostsPerformance. Through an overload (extension method) named ExecuteAsPerformanceAsync<T>, developers may specify the concrete implementation of that interface. This extension method will resolve that implementation type along with any of its constructor-injected dependencies. This avoids the service locator anti-pattern and provides a convenient pattern by which to write performance logic. Use services resolved from the service provider, or injected into your IHostsPerformance implementation, to get access to commonly-used Screenplay services and anything else required at the root level of your performance logic. Into personas Types which derive from IPersona support constructor-injected dependencies. Personas are typically used by either the cast or the stage to get an Actor. The technique in which they are used means that they are resolved, along with their constructor-injected dependencies, from DI. Use constructor-injected dependencies in persona classes to provide access to the APIs required to resolve Abilities that the actor is to be granted. Into performables See the article explaining how performables get their dependencies."

This means that dependency services cannot be constructor-injected into performable types. Performables' state represents parameters Performables are created using the builder pattern and do not hold references to any dependency services. Instead, the state of the performable represents the 'parameters' for that performable. This state is typically set via constructor parameters or public settable properties. An example For example, a Task which adds an item to the user's shopping basket might accept a constructor parameter representing the unique ID of the product to be added to the basket. That unique ID would be stored within the performable instance, in a field or property for example. When the relevant ExecuteAsync method is executed, the unique ID stored in the performable instance is used to conduct whatever logic is appropriate. Use abilities to get dependencies Performables, specifcally Actions and Questions, should access their dependencies via the Actor's [Abilities] by using the GetAbility<T> method or similar. In this sense, Abilities are a form of dependency injection or service locator (for a specific use case). Whilst service locators are usually considered an anti-pattern, the benefits in this specific case outweigh the disadvantages. The primary benefit is the ability to create performables from static builders. Importantly, Tasks should never make use of [Abilities]. Only Actions and Questions should use Abilities."

    "summary": "Writing new Report value formtters To get the best results when Screenplay writes a report, the wording in the reports should be human-readable and avoid language that relates to .NET. Reports are built from report fragments, accumulated during each performance. Baseline reporting functionality It's strongly recommended that all performables and all abilities implement the ICanReport interface. This allows these types to generate report fragments when they are performed-by or granted-to to Actors. Performables and abilities which do not implement ICanReport will use a default/fallback report template which is likely to produce sub-optimal results. Formatting values As noted in the documentation for report fragments, they are written using template strings which include a placeholder syntax. Values must be inserted into these placeholders to get the final report; this is performed by IFormatsReportFragment. There are a few mechanisms by which IFormatsReportFragments converts values to human-readable strings; you are encouraged to pick the most suitable for each scenario. You may extend Screenplay with new implementations of IHasName, IFormattableValue and/or IValueFormatter. Objects with names Actors and some other types implement the interface IHasName. This is suitable for objects which would always appear the same in any report. For example, the Actor \"Joe\" is always \"Joe\"; there's nothing more to their name than that. Self-formattable values Types which implement IFormattableValue have a FormatForReport() method which returns a human-readable formatted representation of that object, suitable for appearance in reports. Use this if the object's state must be used to get the reporting representation, but does not require any external dependencies or services. Obviously, you must have control over the type - the ability to add IFormattableValue to its interfaces - in order to use this technique. Value formatters Value formatters are external objects which are able to format objects, without needing to make any changes to the object-to-be-formatted. Value formatters implement the interface IValueFormatter and must be added to dependency injection, as well as registered with the IFormatterRegistry. The easiest way to perform both of these is to add the Type of the value formatter implementation to ScreenplayOptions.ValueFormatters when creating the Screenplay. Any types added here will automatically be included in the formatter registry and added to DI when the Screenplay is built. Use this technique when either you require external services from dependendency injection to format the object, or if you are unable/unwilling to have the type to be formatted implement IFormattableValue. Use ToString() The least optimal mechanism of formatting values in a report is to rely on the built-in (or an overridden) Object.ToString() method. Whilst this will work in reports, it is intended as fallback functionality for types which are not covered by any of the techniques above. The results of the ToString() method are often a very poor choice for reports."

Requirements which must be fulfilled are crucial to the operation of Screenplay; the integration will malfunction if they are not satisfied. Requirements which should be fulfilled are not crucial, but are strongly recommended for a good developer experience when using the integration. Terminologies differ between testing frameworks; the word Scenario is used to refer to the individual tests that the testing framework executes. The test framework must create an instance of Screenplay before it runs any Scenarios If the test framework uses dependency injection then it is advantageous to integrate Screenplay with that, via AddScreenplay If not then consider the Create factory method Consider permitting extensibility here, using the IGetsScreenplay interface Before any Scenarios run, the framework must execute BeginScreenplay() from the Screenplay instance After all Scenarios have completed it must execute CompleteScreenplay() from the Screenplay instance Each Scenario in the test framework must have its own Performance, within its own a DI lifetime scope Consider using the CreateScopedPerformance method to achieve this The Performance associated with each Scenario should have its NamingHierarchy set according to the name of the Scenario Typically this is done via parameter when creating the Performance It may alternatively be updated after creation Test frameworks have different conventions, so the precise semantics of this name is up to the framework itself The purpose of setting this is to clearly match the Performance to the Scenario to which it relates, when reading reports; if missing then the information will not be present in the report Before the logic of each Scenario starts, the BeginPerformance() method must be executed from the corresponding Performance After the logic of each Scenario ends, the FinishPerformance(bool?) method must be executed from the corresponding Performance After the logic of each Scenario ends, the dependency injection scope associated with the Performance should be disposed Failure to do this could lead to memory leaks or unnecesarily high resource usage whilst the Screenplay is in-progress The test framework must provide access to at least the ICast and IStage, resolved from the Scenario's dependency injection scope, to the Scenario logic The manner of doing this depends entirely on the test framework By way of example, in NUnit this is performed by providing the values of parameters to the test method, in Reqnroll this is performed by resolving step bindng classes from that same DI scope, allowing constructor injection"

Place a line of code somewhere in your test project, outside of any type definition like this: [assembly: CSF.Screenplay.ScreenplayAssembly(typeof(MyScreenplayFactory))] There is one other thing you must do, and that is to write a screenplay factory class, which configures how the Screenplay should be created for your tests. A screenplay factory is a class which must implement IGetsScreenplay. Consider the example below as a starting point for writing your own. using CSF.Screenplay; public class MyScreenplayFactory : IGetsScreenplay { public Screenplay GetScreenplay() { return Screenplay.Create(services => { // Add your own dependency injection service descriptors to the service collection here // For example, services which will be used by Screenplay Abilities. }); } } Important When using NUnit with Screenplay, every Screenplay-using test within a test assembly (thus, within a .NET project) must share the same instance of Screenplay. This is not expected to be problematic, as all the Screenplay object does is set-up the Screenplay architecture and dependency injection for the tests. Writing test methods When writing test methods, the test methods must be decorated with ScreenplayAttribute, which activates Screenplay for that particular test method.

The recommended services to inject into your step binding classes are either IStage or ICast. If you are using Personas, which are the recommended way to get Actors for your performances, then most step binding classes will need only one of the two services above. If you are not using Personas to get actors, then you might also need to inject some services which relate to the Abilities that you wish to grant actors. Example Tip The implied ability, the performables, persona and DishwashingBuilder used in this test, related to washing dishes, are all fictitious. See the documentation for writing performables to learn about how these could be written. This example assumes that Reqnroll is writting using the NUnit runner, and thus it makes use of NUnit-style assertions. Feel free to replace the assertion with whichever assertion library you wish to use. using CSF.Screenplay; using static CSF.Screenplay.PerformanceStarter; using static WashingTheDishes.DishwashingBuilder; [Binding] public class WashTheDishesSteps(IStage stage) { [Given(@\"^Joe was able to get some dirty dishes$\")] public async Task GetDirtyDishes() { var joe = stage.Spotlight<Joe>(); await Given(joe).WasAbleTo(GetSomeDirtyDishes()); } [When(@\"^(?:he|she|they) attempts? to wash the dishes$\")] public async Task WashTheDishes() { var actor = stage.GetSpotlitActor(); await When(actor).AttemptsTo(WashTheDishes()); } [Then(@\"^(?:he|she|they) should see that the dishes are clean$\")] public async Task GetDirtyDishes() { var actor = stage.GetSpotlitActor(); var condition = await Then(actor).Should(LookAtTheDishesCondition()); Assert.That(condition, Is.EqualTo(\"Clean\")); } }"

A Screenplay may have as many Performances as it needs. Let's revisit the diagram from the previous article, looking in more detail at the makeup of a Performance. The diagram below omits the Screenplay and consuming logic. On the other hand, it includes some concepts which were omitted from the previous diagram. block-beta columns 4 Performance:4 Actors Performables:3 space Tasks:3 space:4 Abilities Actions Questions otherTasks[\"Other Tasks\"] space:4 ext[\"Screenplay extension\"]:3 style ext fill:#EE9,stroke:#AA4 Abilities -- \"Provide\\ncapabilities\" --> Actors Actions -- \"Compose\" --> Tasks Questions -- \"Compose\" --> Tasks otherTasks -- \"Compose\" --> Tasks ext -- \"Provide\" --> Abilities ext -- \"Provide\" --> Actions ext -- \"Provide\" --> Questions The three kinds of performable All performables will fall into one of three categories. Recall that a performable is a reusable piece of logic. In C# or VB.NET, each performable is a class. Actions are the smallest possible piece of logic to do something; they make a single, granular change Questions are the smallest possible piece of logic to query, get or read something; they do not change things Tasks are higher-level pieces of logic which are composed from any of Actions, Questions or other Tasks Note that these three 'kinds' do not correspond directly to .NET types, such as interfaces. By coincidence, there are three base interfaces for performables; these do not correspond to Actions, Questions and Tasks. Actions and Questions are usually provided by a Screenplay Extension. Most performables are Tasks; developers using Screenplay will write their own tasks, which make use of the Actions and Questions and compose them into pieces of logic which are relevant to their application. Abilities provide capabilities to Actors Abilities are classes which provide capabilities to Actors who 'have' that ability. Abilities are usually provided by a Screenplay Extension and each typically enables the Actor to use Actions & Questions which interact with a specific technology. An example of an ability is one named BrowseTheWeb, which is provided by the CSF.Screenplay.Selenium extension. The BrowseTheWeb ability grants the Actor the capability to make use of a Selenium WebDriver, to control desktop web browsers from .NET code. Screenplay extensions: Bundles of Abilities, Actions & Questions This brings us along to what a Screenplay Extension is. Each Extension provides a set of Abilities, Actions and Questions which deal with a specific technology. Two examples are: CSF.Screenplay.Selenium - provides an ability to control desktop Web Browsers along with Actions & Questions representing each fine-grained interaction with the browser CSF.Screenplay.WebApis - provides an ability, actions and questions to make requests to web API endpoints Next: What's it like using Screenplay?

    "title": "Sample performances | Screenplay",
    "summary": "Sample performances Let's take a look at what a Performance looks like. The following is written in C#, as a test, using the NUnit syntax, using the CSF.Screenplay.Selenium extension. This was selected to demonstrate a variety of Screenplay's features, used in a manner that's close to a real-world scenario. NUnit is a popular testing framework, recognisable to most .NET developers. using static CSF.Screenplay.PerformanceStarter; using static MyAppNamespace.ShoppingCartBuilder; [Test, Screenplay] public async Task TheQuantityOfAnItemShouldBeIncrementedAfterAddingAnother(ICast cast) { var webster = cast.GetActor<Webster>(); await Given(webster).WasAbleTo(OpenTheAppWithAnEmptyShoppingCart()); await Given(webster).WasAbleTo(AddAProductToTheirCartNamed(\"Blue widget\")); await When(webster).AttemptsTo(AddAProductToTheirCartNamed(\"Blue widget\")); var quantity = await Then(webster).Should(ReadTheQuantityOfItemsInTheirCartNamed(\"Blue widget\")); Assert.That(quantity, Is.EqualTo(2)); } [Test, Screenplay] public async Task TheTotalValueOfTheCartShouldEqualTheQuantityMultipliedByUnitPrice(ICast cast) { var admira = cast.GetActor<Admira>(); var webster = cast.GetActor<Webster>(); await Given(admira).WasAbleTo(SetThePriceOfAProduct(\"Blue widget\", \"$4.99\")); await Given(webster).WasAbleTo(OpenTheAppWithAnEmptyShoppingCart()); await Given(webster).WasAbleTo(AddAProductToTheirCartNamed(\"Blue widget\")); await When(webster).AttemptsTo(AddAProductToTheirCartNamed(\"Blue widget\")); var quantity = await Then(webster).Should(ReadTheTotalValueOfTheirCart()); Assert.That(quantity, Is.EqualTo(\"$9.98\")); } Notable features Let's look a little more deeply into these two performances. The headings below point out how they differ from normal NUnit tests; these differences are the features of Screenplay. Static usings for builders At the very beginning of the code listing are two using static declarations. Screenplay relies heavily on the builder pattern, including static builders, in order to provide a fluent interface. The static builder PerformanceStarter is common to Screenplay when using tests; the second is fictious. ShoppingCartBuilder is provided as an example of a builder that the author of these tests might have written for their own performables. The [Screenplay] attribute When using Screenplay with NUnit, each test method must have the [Screenplay] attribute. This requirement is specific to the NUnit integration for Screenplay. The ICast parameter The Cast is one of the mechanisms by which the Performance logic may access Actors. Just like in a real-life theater performance, the Cast is a collection of the Actors who are involved. Part of the role of the [Screenplay] attribute (above) is to provide an appropriate implementation of the Cast object to NUnit, so that it may be 'parameter injected' into tests as shown here. The strongly-typed Actors Notice how when the cast is used to get actors, it uses a class with the actor's name as the generic type parameter to GetActor? This is a technique called a Persona; personas are the best way to define Actors. The logic which grants/configures the Actors' Abilities is contained within a reusable Persona class. This way the same-named actor has the same abilities across every Performance in the Screenplay, making them easy to recognise and understand. Good Personas/Actors have names which remind you of their role in the Performance. In this case Admira is an Administrator, who can edit the prices of items for sale in the app. Webster is someone browsing the web, who is otherwise unremarkable. The Given/When/Then methods When writing a test, Given/When/Then (aka Arrange/Act/Assert) is a popular way to organise test logic. This is available in Screenplay and (if using it for tests) developers are encouraged to use it to separate set-up logic, the logic which conducts the test, and logic which leads to an assertion. These three methods (which take an Actor as a parameter) are followed-up with either a WasAbleTo, AttemptsTo or Should method. These three follow-up methods are synomymous and none have any limitations or functionality different from the others. They are named differently only to improve the readability of the test logic. The performables There are a number of Performables used in these two performances. All the performables listed above would be Tasks, because they are high-level verbs which are written in terms of the application being tested. To use syntax like this, it is assumed that there are some static factory/builder methods on a (fictitious) class named ShoppingCartBuilder, accessible without the class name via the using static declaration (above). The Performables included in these tests are: OpenTheAppWithAnEmptyShoppingCart AddAProductToTheirCartNamed ReadTheQuantityOfItemsInTheirCartNamed SetThePriceOfAProduct ReadTheTotalValueOfTheirCart Just by reading the code, we can already see that: Some of these Performables can accept parameters Some of these Performables can return results Notice how each of these tasks is named in a manner which makes it very clear and obvious what they accomplish. Each name begins with a verb, and their name would make sense to both developers and non-developers alike, assuming they are at least familiar with the application/domain of logic in question. The assertions Notice that the assertions at the end of each test is a normal NUnit assertion. When writing tests using Screenplay it is best practice to place any assertions outside of any Performables; write it at the end of the Performance (end of the test) just like any other test. Next: Let's see some of those Tasks Read page 4, in which we take two of the Tasks from this example and examine their code"

    "title": "Sample tasks | Screenplay",
    "summary": "Sample tasks This introductory documentation continues the example from the previous page. On that page we looked at two sample Performances and what their code might look like. In this page we consider the logic of two Task classes. Recall, a Task is a piece of performable logic which may compose any of Actions, Questions and/or other Tasks. Adding an item to the shopping cart The first task we will consider is the Task which was named AddAProductToTheirCartNamed on the previous page. public static class SitewideUi { public static readonly Locator ProductSearchTextbox = ElementId(\"product-search\", \"the product search\"); public static readonly Locator ProductSearchNowButton = ElementId(\"execute-product-search\", \"the search button\"); } public static class ProductSearchResultsPage { public static readonly Locator AddToCartButtonForProductNamed(string productName) => CssSelector($\"ol.search-results li[data-productName='{productName}'] .addToCart\"); } public class AddAProductToTheirCartNamed(string productName) : IPerformable, ICanReport { public async ValueTask PerformAsAsync(ICanPerform actor, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default) { await actor.PerformAsync(EnterTheText(productName).Into(SitewideUi.ProductSearchTextbox), cancellationToken); await actor.PerformAsync(ClickOn(SitewideUi.ProductSearchNowButton), cancellationToken); var addToCartButton = ProductSearchResultsPage.AddToCartButtonForProductNamed(productName); await actor.PerformAsync(ClickOn(addToCartButton), cancellationToken); } public ReportFragment GetReportFragment(Actor actor, IFormatsReportFragment formatter) => formatter.Format(\"{Actor} searches for '{ProductName}' and adds one to their cart\", actor, productName); } Reading the cart's total value Now let's consider some code which might form the logic of the Task named ReadTheTotalValueOfTheirCart. public static class ShoppingCartPage { public static readonly Locator TotalCartValue = ElementId(\"cart-value\", \"the total cart value\"); } public class ReadTheTotalValueOfTheirCart : IPerformableWithResult<string>, ICanReport { public async ValueTask<string> PerformAsAsync(ICanPerform actor, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default) { await actor.PerformAsync(NavigateToTheirShoppingCart(), cancellationToken); return await actor.PerformAsync(ReadFromTheElement(ShoppingCartPage.TotalCartValue).TheText(), cancellationToken); } public ReportFragment GetReportFragment(Actor actor, IFormatsReportFragment formatter) => formatter.Format(\"{Actor} reads the total value of their cart\", actor, productName); } Inspecting these two Tasks Now, we will disect the code of these two sample Tasks, to see what we can learn from them. Tasks coordinate other Performables Common to both tasks is that they make prolific use of actor.PerformAsync. This is the mechanism by which Task classes compose other Performables, which may include any or all of Actions, Questions or other Tasks. These consumed Performables are built in the same manner, using the same builders and/or static factories, as if they were being used directly from the Performance logic. As a side-note, the first of these sample Tasks is built using only Actions. The EnterTheText and ClickOn builder methods create Actions, which are built into the CSF.Screenplay.Selenium Extension. The second sample Task makes use of a Question from the same Extension. ReadFromTheElement followed by TheText gets a Question which reads text from the web browser screen. On the other hand, the second sample Task makes use of (a fictitious) Task as well: NavigateToTheirShoppingCart. If this were a real project then the developer would have written that Task also, including whatever logic is required to navigate the current user to their shopping cart screen. Note The same PerformAsync method is used to consume Actions, Questions or Tasks. So, Tasks may consume any kind of Performable. Always implement ICanReport, if you can Notice how each of the Task classes also implements ICanReport? One of the features/benefits of Screenplay which we have not yet touched upon is its ability to produce detailed human-readable Reports of the Performances. By implementing ICanReport, you may decide upon the human-readable report text that the current Task emits to describe itself. Tasks may be built on assumptions Notice that in the Performance in which it was used, the AddAProductToTheirCartNamed task was preceded by a task named OpenTheAppWithAnEmptyShoppingCart. You might infer from this that - if the current Actor had not already navigated to the web application, the Add a Product task would not function correctly. If you did, that's completely correct. The Add a Product task assumes that the current Actor (a user of the shopping web app) already has their browser open somewhere on the app. Note It's perfectly reasonable, recommended in fact, for Tasks to use implicit assumptions about the state of the application. It's encouraged to document these, to aid reusability. Well-known parameters are held in static classes Notice the static classes which are used alongside these tasks. Each provides some Locators which specify some HTML elements on the screen. Locators and HTML elements are specific to the CSF.Screenplay.Selenium Extension, but the principle is the same regardless of the extension. If there's a well-known value, a URL, a file system path, etc, then represent this value in your code. This way it may be referenced by builders and the fluent design of Screenplay Performables.

    "summary": "Introduction to Screenplay Screenplay is a software design pattern for scripting processes which are made from a series of steps, executed in order. It is particularly useful when many of those steps have a lot in common, making them reuseable. This has seen Screenplay become popular for writing the logic of Behavior-driven development tests. Despite this, Screenplay is not limited to just testing logic. How Screenplay fits into an architecture This diagram provides a very high-level look at where Screenplay lies within the architecture of your software. block-beta columns 3 consumer[\"Screenplay consumer\"]:2 yours[\"Your app, or\\na test framework\"] screenplay[\"Screenplay framework\\nand extensions\"]:2 space Performances:2 script[\"Each is a script\\nwith a beginning & end\"] Actors Performables reusable[\"Reusable\\nbuilding blocks\"] classDef label fill:transparent,stroke:transparent classDef screenplayCode fill:#EE9,stroke:#AA4 class screenplay screenplayCode class yours,script,reusable label The Screenplay consumer The Screenplay consumer is whatever software is using Screenplay. If you are using Screenplay for testing then this is likely a software testing framework such as NUnit or Reqnroll (formerly SpecFlow, until it was discontinued). As noted above, Screenplay can be used by any .NET logic, not just testing frameworks. Screenplay framework and extensions The Screenplay framework is the library/NuGet package CSF.Screenplay. This provides the 'engine' by which the Performances (below) may be executed. Screenplay alone is just an extensible engine, it's not capable of very much on its own. Screenplay extensions provide you with pre-written Performables. Performables shipped with extensions are low-level building blocks which interact with a specific technology. Once you have installed an extension, you may go on to write your own higher-level Performances, using those which are shipped with the extension. Performances A performance is a script; a multi-step process to follow, with a beginning and an end. An app or test framework using Screenplay may have as many performances as it needs. A performance should have a name which a non-developer can understand, so long as they are familiar with your software. If you are using Screenplay as a BDD testing tool then each performance corresponds directly to one test scenario; the name of the performance is the name of the test. Actors Screenplay logic, within each performance, is written from the perspective of Actors. Actors often represent human users of your software, particularly when using Screenplay for testing. An actor might also represent an automated process which is external to the software which Screenplay is controlling. Performables Each performable is a reusable building block of .NET logic; a performable is something that an actor may do. It's completely normal, encouraged even, for performables to be made-of (composed-from) other performables. This way, writing a new performance which is a variation upon an existing performance benefits from maximum code-reuse, minimising code copy-pasting. Next: Introduction to Performances Read page 2 to learn more about the makeup of a Performance."

    "summary": "Web APIs Screenplay may be used to interact with Web APIs. Key to this is Ability class MakeWebApiRequests, along with a number of performables and types which represent API endpoints. Use WebApiBuilder to simplify usage The section & table below indicates the combinations of 'endpoint' & performable to use for several common use cases. If the correct endpoint has been used though, the WebApiBuilder class will make it very easy to select the correct performable, by type inference. For any requests which are expecting to read a response as a JSON string, to be deserialized, use an overload of GetTheJsonResult from the static web API builder. For any other requests, use an overload of SendTheHttpRequest. The recommended way to use this builder is via using static CSF.Screenplay.WebApis.WebApiBuilder; in the source file for a custom performable. Combinations of endpoints & performables for common usages The performable which should be used, along with the approproate endpoint type depends upon your use case, summarised in the table below. The table is organised by the expected body/content of the HTTP request, the request payload and the expected type of the response body. Where None is listed, this usually means that either the request or response have no body, such as an HTTP GET request that does not send a body or an empty response. In the case of responses this might alternatively mean that the response body will be ignored or will not be interpreted as an instance of any particular type.

    "href": "docs/writingPerformables/AllowCooperativeCancellation.html",
    "title": "Allow cooperative cancellation | Screenplay",
    "summary": "Allow cooperative cancellation All Performables implement one of three interfaces and each of these interfaces exposes a PerformAsAsync method which accepts a CancellationToken as a parameter. This cancellation token is to facilitate cooperative cancellation, so that a Performance may be cancelled/terminated gracefully. If an Action or Question makes use of an asynchronous method from an Ability then pass the cancellation token as a parameter to the Ability method that is used. Any time a Performance or Task executes a performable, pass the cancellation token down to the consumed performable as a parameter. Consider the strategies below for dealing with long-running synchronous methods, which do not natively participate in cooperative cancellation. There is no need for every performable (particularly tasks) to execute ThrowIfCancellationRequested() as a matter of course. Many performables complete their logic in microseconds or less, so excess cancellation-checking will bloat the logic for no perceivable gain. So long as the cancellation token is passed from 'the top of the Performance' downwards, and any Actions or Questions which perform async or long-running logic are cancellation-enabled, cancellation should work in a timely fashion. Dealing with long-running synchronous methods Sometimes an Action or Question will need to make use of functionality from an Ability which does not support cooperative cancellation. If such functionality is long-running then this can interfere with cancellation. It can lead to performances which take a long time to respond to cancellation of/when it is requested. Perhaps it's legacy code which predates the asynchronous programming model Perhaps it doesn't conform to best practice and doesn't accept a cancellation token parameter Here are two suggestions to deal with this. Throw if cancellation requested Cancellation token objects have a method ThrowIfCancellationRequested() which will interrupt and throw an exception if cancellation has been requested. You may use this method directly before executing a long-running synchronous (non-cancelable) Ability method. This won't cancel the long-running method if cancellation is requested after it has started its work, but it will prevent it from being started if cancellation is already requested. Use this technique if it's more important that the long-running method is not interrupted than it is to support timely cancellation. Use Task.Wait to make the long-running method interruptible An alternative strategy for dealing with long-running synchronous methods is to wrap the method execution in a new Task and use Task.Wait() to interrupt the task if cancellation is requested. Here's an example of that technique in action, applied to the PerformAsAsync method of a performable. public ValueTask PerformAsAsync(ICanPerform actor, CancellationToken cancellationToken) { Task.Run(() => LongRunningMethod()).Wait(cancellationToken); return default; } Use this technique if it's acceptable to send the long-running method into a separate thread and to 'give up waiting' for it to complete if cancellation has been requested. This technique might provide better responsiveness to cancellation than the one above, albeit it is the most likely to produce unexpected impact on the behaviour of the performable. Note that, as is standard for usage of Task.Wait(), cancelling the wait does not abort the execution of the long-running method. The thread which is executing that logic will usually continue and run to completion. Interrupting the wait just means that the main performance thread stops waiting for the other thread to complete."

This is particularly true when Screenplay is being used as a tool for testing. Good test logic has a cyclomatic complexity of precisely one. Sometimes looping logic is unavoidable and desirable in a Screenplay, imagine a performable which has an Actor repeat a process N times. This is acceptable if used judiciously. Performables should always avoid branching logic like if or switch though, and should never contain such logic when being used for tests. If more than one mode of operation is required then write more than one performable. The path through a Performance should be completely deterministic, short of an unexpected error or failure."

Screenplay recommends the resolution of many services from DI, including Personas, the Cast, Stage and Abilities. It is not a good idea to resolve Performable object instances from DI, though. Because performables should be immutable but stateful, this requires all of their state to be set at the time of their construction, such as via constructor parameters or properties with init setters. Unfortunately, this state represents the configuration of how the performable will be used, so it will be entirely down to the particular usage of the performable. This would make the use of DI quite cumbersome, as many arbitrary parameter values must be passed to the resolution. What's more, performables should not depend upon anything which is resolved from DI. At most, Actions and Questions may depend upon an Actor's Abilities but they should access these from the first parameter of the PerformAsAsync method; the ICanPerform parameter (the actor). Instead, it is far better to use the builder pattern to create instances of performables."

Accept as many parameters as are reasonable, although avoid going so far that parameterisation makes a Performable unclear as to what it does. An example Imagine we are writing a Task which makes a cup of coffee, ready to serve. It would make sense to include parameters which decide the strength of the coffee, how much milk and sweetener to add and similar. It would usually be a mistake to create a Task which can make any hot drink, where the parameters provided decide which hot drink to make. The processes for making various hot drinks are often fundamentally different; consider the process for making coffee and then that for brewing tea. In the most extreme case, where such a Task is required, separate the logic of making of each hot drink into Tasks of their own, and consume/execute the relevant one of these from the any hot drink Task."

    "summary": "Ability An ability is an arbitrary object which may be granted to Actors in order to allow them to interact with the application as part of a Performance. Unlike many other Screenplay object-types, there is no particular interface which Abilities must implement, as their functionality, capabilities and very nature are specific to them alone. That said - it is recommended for Abilities to implement ICanReport if possible, as this allows for the production of a more pleasant human-readable report. Actions and/or Questions may interact directly with an actor's abilities in order to perform their functionality. Tasks, on the other hand, should not. The purpose of abilities Abilities typically have one (or more) of the following purposes. They provide a Gateway or Façade to external functionality They provide access to dependency services They provide a model of data, such as: Secrets/access tokens for an API to be consumed by abilities Contextual per-performance state Abilities are intended to be used by Actions and/or Questions, not Tasks. Abilities provide the dependencies that those performables require, because performables cannot participate in constructor-injected dependency injection. Abilities can receive constructor-injected dependencies from DI, making them an ideal technique to provide dependencies to performables."

Specifically, an action should be the smallest, most granular change or interaction possible; something which cannot reasonably be split into constituent parts. In an application of Screenplay which controls a web browser, an action might be a single mouse click, or entering some specified text into an input field. To create higher-level interactions, use Tasks to compose actions. Out of the kinds of performable, actions are the smallest building blocks available. Actions don't have a direct representation in Screenplay code because they are really just an arbitrary category of performable. Actions most commonly implement the IPerformable interface though, as they usually do not return any results. Generally, the logic of actions interacts directly with the actor's Abilities in order to provide the functionality required to perform the action."

    "href": "glossary/Performable.html",
    "title": "Performable | Screenplay",
    "summary": "Performable A 'performable' is a verb in the language of Screenplay; performables are things that Actors do. Performables are logically grouped into one of the following three kinds. Do not be mistaken in believing that these three kinds of performable correspond to the three interfaces which are listed later on this page. This is entirely coincidental and there is no direct equivalence. Actions are the most granular of individual interactions with the application, composable to form higher-order interactions Questions are granular, like actions, but read the application's state to get information instead of making changes Tasks are higher-order interactions which are formed by composing actions, questions and/or other tasks Performables are reusable As noted above, Tasks may use any of Actions, Questions or other Tasks. There is no limit to this composition/reusability. It's perfectly normal to write a task which makes use of several tasks, which thesmevles make use of several other tasks and so on. Each higher-level task composes lower-level tasks. At the very end of the composition will of course be Actions/Questions but there is no limit to the number of 'layers' of tasks. Performable instances are not reusable Types which implement the performable interfaces (below) are stateful objects which are often mutable. Their state defines their configuration, as such, instances of any performable type must not be reused. Typically, performables are created using a builder which configures their state. Each performable object is used precisely once by an actor and then discarded. Even if you would like to perform the same operation twice, do not attempt to reuse an object instance; use the builder twice to create two (identical) instances of the same performable type. Developers using Screenplay will typically be writing Tasks Actions & Questions are the smallest/low-level building blocks of a Screenplay Performance. They are parameterized and should make as few assumptions as possible. As such, they should be highly reusable. Actions & Questions rarely need to be written by developers who are using Screenplay. That is because most likely, the Action, Question and corresponding Ability classes will have been provided in a library, such as a NuGet package. On the other hand, Tasks are higher-level performables which may compose Actions, Questions and/or other lower-level Tasks. Developers using Screenplay should write as many Tasks as they need. Tasks may represent any of the - possibly complex - interactions performed by the Actor. Actions & Questions should interact directly with the Actor's Abilities to perform their logic; in most cases Tasks should not directly use any Abilities. When writing your own performables, consider these best practices for the best results. The three performable interfaces, and ICanReport In Screenplay code, a Performance is a script of sorts, written from at least one performable, usually several. All performables must implement one of the following three interfaces, but it's also strongly recommended to implement ICanReport as well. As noted above, it is coincidence alone that there are three kinds of performable and three interfaces for performables. There is no direct correlation between these interfaces and the kinds of performable. IPerformable IPerformableWithResult IPerformableWithResult<TResult>"

    "summary": "Persona A Persona is a class which serves as a factory for a specific Actor. In Screenplay, it is strongly recommended to create and re-use well-known Actors across your Performances. That is, if an actor with a specified Name has a certain set of Abilities in one Performance, then ideally all actors of the same name should have that same set of abilities in other performances. This leads to the creation of well-known Actors which are well-understood by the team who are working with Screenplay. Personas help facilitate that by providing a reusable location at which to set the actor's name and to assign & configure their abilities. Personas in Screenplay are classes which implement the IPersona interface."

Similar to Actions, questions should be as small in their scope as possible, to make them as reusable and composable as possible. In code, questions get a value and return it to the consuming logic, so they will always implement one of IPerformableWithResult<TResult> or its non-generic counterpart IPerformableWithResult. In an application of Screenplay which controls a web browser, a questions might represent reading the text from a single HTML element, or reading the enabled/disabled state of a button. To create higher-level questions with broader scope, compose them with Tasks. Generally, the logic of questions interacts directly with the actor's Abilities in order to provide the functionality required to get the requested information."

The scenario directly corresponds to a single Performance, and within are contained all of the Performables for that performance. Performables in a report are also included hierarchically. This means that high-level Tasks contain information about the performables from which they are composed. Reports are useful to document what has been performed in a Screenplay.

Screenplay uses the name \"Scenario\" because this matches the name used in Cucumber. Scenarios are only relevant when Screenplay is used in conjunction with a test framework integration. The concept of a Scenario is irrelevant when using Screenplay standalone. A Scenario represents the lifetime of each individual test; when using Screenplay as a testing tool, the lifetime of the Scenario corresponds very closely to the lifetime of a Performance. When using Screenplay, each Performance (and thus Scenario) is executed within its own Dependency Injection Lifetime Scope. Every scenario is typically contained within a Feature. The structure of scenarios-within-features may be represented in the Performance using the NamingHierarchy. Other names for Scenarios Various testing frameworks have established different naming conventions for what is - fundamentally - the same thing.
