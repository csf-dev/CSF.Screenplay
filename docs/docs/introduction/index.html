<h1 id="introduction-to-screenplay">Introduction to Screenplay</h1>

<p>Screenplay is a software design pattern for scripting processes which are made from a series of steps, executed in order.
It is particularly useful when many of those steps have a lot in common, making them reuseable.
This has seen Screenplay become popular for writing the logic of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">Behavior-driven development tests</a>.
Despite this, <em>Screenplay is not limited to just testing logic</em>.</p>
<h2 id="how-screenplay-fits-into-an-architecture">How Screenplay fits into an architecture</h2>
<p>This diagram provides a very high-level look at where Screenplay lies within the architecture of your software.</p>

<h3 id="the-screenplay-consumer">The Screenplay consumer</h3>
<p>The Screenplay consumer is <em>whatever software is using Screenplay</em>.
If you are using Screenplay for testing then this is likely a software testing framework such as <a href="https://nunit.org/">NUnit</a> or <a href="https://reqnroll.net/">Reqnroll</a> (formerly SpecFlow, <a href="https://reqnroll.net/news/2025/01/specflow-end-of-life-has-been-announced/">until it was discontinued</a>).
As noted above, Screenplay can be used by any .NET logic, not just testing frameworks.</p>
<h3 id="screenplay-framework-and-extensions">Screenplay framework and extensions</h3>
<p>The Screenplay framework is the library/NuGet package <strong><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/CSF.Screenplay">CSF.Screenplay</a></strong>.
This provides the 'engine' by which the Performances (below) may be executed.</p>
<p>Screenplay alone is just an extensible engine, it's not capable of very much on its own.
<strong>Screenplay extensions</strong> provide you with pre-written Performables.
Performables shipped with extensions are low-level building blocks which interact with a specific technology.
Once you have installed an extension, you may go on to write your own higher-level Performances, using those which are shipped with the extension.</p>
<h3 id="performances">Performances</h3>
<p>A performance is a script; a multi-step process to follow, with a beginning and an end.
An app or test framework using Screenplay may have as many performances as it needs.
A performance should have a name which a non-developer can understand, so long as they are familiar with your software.
If you are using Screenplay as a BDD testing tool then each performance corresponds directly to one test scenario; the name of the performance is the name of the test.</p>
<h3 id="actors">Actors</h3>
<p>Screenplay logic, within each performance, is written from the perspective of Actors.
Actors often represent human users of your software, particularly when using Screenplay for testing.
An actor might also represent an automated process which is external to the software which Screenplay is controlling.</p>
<h3 id="performables">Performables</h3>
<p>Each performable is a reusable building block of .NET logic; a performable is <em>something that an actor may do</em>.
It's completely normal, encouraged even, for performables to be made-of (composed-from) other performables.
This way, writing a new performance which is a variation upon an existing performance benefits from maximum code-reuse, minimising code copy-pasting.</p>
