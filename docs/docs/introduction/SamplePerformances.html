<h1 id="sample-performances">Sample performances</h1>

<p>Let's take a look at what a Performance looks like.
The following is written in C#, as a test, using <a href="https://nunit.org/">the NUnit syntax</a>, using the <strong>CSF.Screenplay.Selenium</strong> extension.
This was selected to demonstrate a variety of Screenplay's features, used in a manner that's close to a real-world scenario.
NUnit is a popular testing framework, recognisable to most .NET developers.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">using static CSF.Screenplay.PerformanceStarter;
using static MyAppNamespace.ShoppingCartBuilder;

[Test, Screenplay]
public async Task TheQuantityOfAnItemShouldBeIncrementedAfterAddingAnother(ICast cast)
{
    var webster = cast.GetActor&lt;Webster&gt;();

    await Given(webster).WasAbleTo(OpenTheAppWithAnEmptyShoppingCart());
    await Given(webster).WasAbleTo(AddAProductToTheirCartNamed(&quot;Blue widget&quot;));
    await When(webster).AttemptsTo(AddAProductToTheirCartNamed(&quot;Blue widget&quot;));
    var quantity = await Then(webster).Should(ReadTheQuantityOfItemsInTheirCartNamed(&quot;Blue widget&quot;));

    Assert.That(quantity, Is.EqualTo(2));
}

[Test, Screenplay]
public async Task TheTotalValueOfTheCartShouldEqualTheQuantityMultipliedByUnitPrice(ICast cast)
{
    var admira = cast.GetActor&lt;Admira&gt;();
    var webster = cast.GetActor&lt;Webster&gt;();

    await Given(admira).WasAbleTo(SetThePriceOfAProduct(&quot;Blue widget&quot;, &quot;$4.99&quot;));
    await Given(webster).WasAbleTo(OpenTheAppWithAnEmptyShoppingCart());
    await Given(webster).WasAbleTo(AddAProductToTheirCartNamed(&quot;Blue widget&quot;));
    await When(webster).AttemptsTo(AddAProductToTheirCartNamed(&quot;Blue widget&quot;));
    var quantity = await Then(webster).Should(ReadTheTotalValueOfTheirCart());

    Assert.That(quantity, Is.EqualTo(&quot;$9.98&quot;));
}

<h2 id="notable-features">Notable features</h2>
<p>Let's look a little more deeply into these two performances.
The headings below point out how they differ from normal NUnit tests; these differences are the features of Screenplay.</p>
<h3 id="static-usings-for-builders">Static usings for builders</h3>
<p>At the very beginning of the code listing are two <code>using static</code> declarations.
Screenplay relies heavily on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern">the builder pattern</a>, including static builders, in order to provide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface">a fluent interface</a>.
The static builder <a class="xref" href="../../api/CSF.Screenplay.PerformanceStarter.html"><code>PerformanceStarter</code></a> is common to Screenplay when using tests; the second is fictious.
<code>ShoppingCartBuilder</code> is provided as an example of a builder that the author of these tests might have written for their own performables.</p>
<h3 id="the-screenplay-attribute">The <code>[Screenplay]</code> attribute</h3>
<p>When using Screenplay with NUnit, each test method must have <a class="xref" href="../../api/CSF.Screenplay.ScreenplayAttribute.html">the <code>[Screenplay]</code> attribute</a>.
This requirement is specific to the NUnit integration for Screenplay.</p>
<h3 id="the-icast-parameter">The <code>ICast</code> parameter</h3>
<p>The <strong>Cast</strong> is one of the mechanisms by which the Performance logic may access <strong>Actors</strong>.
Just like in a real-life theater performance, the Cast is a collection of the Actors who are involved.
Part of the role of the <code>[Screenplay]</code> attribute (above) is to provide an appropriate implementation of the Cast object to NUnit, so that it may be 'parameter injected' into tests as shown here.</p>
<h3 id="the-strongly-typed-actors">The strongly-typed Actors</h3>
<p>Notice how when the cast is used to get actors, it uses a class with the actor's name as the generic type parameter to <code>GetActor</code>?
This is <a href="../../glossary/Persona.html">a technique called a Persona</a>; personas are the best way to define Actors.
The logic which grants/configures the Actors' <strong>Abilities</strong> is contained within a reusable Persona class.
This way the same-named actor has the same abilities across every Performance in the Screenplay, making them easy to recognise and understand.</p>
<p>Good Personas/Actors have names which remind you of their role in the Performance.
In this case <strong>Admira</strong> is an Administrator, who can edit the prices of items for sale in the app.
<strong>Webster</strong> is someone browsing the web, who is otherwise unremarkable.</p>
<h3 id="the-givenwhenthen-methods">The Given/When/Then methods</h3>
<p>When writing a test, Given/When/Then (aka Arrange/Act/Assert) is a popular way to organise test logic.
This is available in Screenplay and (if using it for tests) developers are encouraged to use it to separate set-up logic, the logic which conducts the test, and logic which leads to an assertion.</p>
<p>These three methods (which take an Actor as a parameter) are followed-up with either a <code>WasAbleTo</code>, <code>AttemptsTo</code> or <code>Should</code> method.
These three follow-up methods are synomymous and none have any limitations or functionality different from the others.
They are named differently only to improve the readability of the test logic.</p>
<h3 id="the-performables">The performables</h3>
<p>There are a number of Performables used in these two performances.
All the performables listed above would be <strong>Tasks</strong>, because they are high-level verbs which are written in terms of the application being tested.</p>
<p>To use syntax like this, it is assumed that there are some static factory/builder methods on a (fictitious) class named <code>ShoppingCartBuilder</code>, accessible without the class name via the <code>using static</code> declaration (above).
The Performables included in these tests are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>OpenTheAppWithAnEmptyShoppingCart</code></li>
<li><code>AddAProductToTheirCartNamed</code></li>
<li><code>ReadTheQuantityOfItemsInTheirCartNamed</code></li>
<li><code>SetThePriceOfAProduct</code></li>
<li><code>ReadTheTotalValueOfTheirCart</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Just by reading the code, we can already see that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of these Performables can accept parameters</li>
<li>Some of these Performables can return results</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice how each of these tasks is named in a manner which makes it very clear and obvious what they accomplish.
Each name begins with a verb, and their name would make sense to both developers and non-developers alike, assuming they are at least familiar with the application/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_(software_engineering)">domain of logic</a> in question.</p>
<h3 id="the-assertions">The assertions</h3>
<p>Notice that the assertions at the end of each test is <em>a normal NUnit assertion</em>.
When writing tests using Screenplay it is best practice to place any assertions <em>outside of any Performables</em>; write it at the end of the Performance (end of the test) just like any other test.</p>
