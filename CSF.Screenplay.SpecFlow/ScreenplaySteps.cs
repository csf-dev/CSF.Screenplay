    /// In SpecFlow 3.x, the <c>Steps</c> class has three methods named <c>Given</c>, <c>When</c> &amp; <c>Then</c> which can cause
    /// a naming conflict with the same-named methods of <see cref="PerformanceStarter"/>.  If you using the performance starter in
    /// the recommended way, then the methods of these two types can become ambiguous and force the developer to write additional
    /// boilerplate which spoils the ease-of-comprehension for Screenplay-based test logic.
    /// This subclass of <c>Steps</c> provides a workaround to that situation. Instead of deriving from the SpecFlow Steps class and including
    /// <c>using static CSF.Screenplay.PerformanceStarter;</c> at the top of your source file, have your bindings derive from this
    /// class instead. This provides Given, When, Then methods which have the same functionality as those in <see cref="PerformanceStarter"/>
    /// but in a manner which will not cause a name-resolution conflict.

    /// SpecFlow <c>Steps</c> class were removed in v4.x. This means that the naming conflict won't be present and that there is no need
    /// for your bindings to derive from this class instead of the official Steps class.

    /// as a best-practice alternative to calling-steps-from-steps.
