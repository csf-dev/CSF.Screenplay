# CSF.Screenplay.JsonToHtmlReport

**CSF.Screenplay.JsonToHtmlReport** is a utility which converts a JSON-format [Screenplay Report] into a human-readable, interactive HTML page.
This is particularly useful if you wish to share the results of your Screenplay Performances with developers and non-developers alike.

This project may also be consumed as a library to add HTML report-generation capabilities to your own application.
