# Sample BrowserStack configs

These configs are present for Cross Browser Testing (CBT) using [BrowserStack].
They are used only by the appropriate CBT CI builds on GitHub Actions.

Note that each omits the `userName` and `accessKey` properties, as these are secrets.
If you wish to use them, you must provide your own BrowserStack credentials.
